Solubility is the property of a solute to dissolve in a solvent to form a homogeneous solution . 

Solubility is defined as the maximum amount of solute that can be dissolved in a specified amount of solvent at a specific temperature.  
Solubility is the result of an interaction between particles of the solute and the solvent. Hence, it depends on the nature of the solute and the solvent, as well as on the temperature and pressure. However, note that the solubility of solids in liquids is independent of pressure.
Let us first discuss the solubility of solids in liquids. 
The solubility of solids in liquids depends upon two factors, namely the nature of the solute and solvent, and the temperature. Letâ€™s discuss how solubility depends on the nature of the solute and solvent.
It is observed that while sodium chloride and sugar dissolve readily in water, naphthalene and anthracene do not.
In general, solubility follows the rule â€œlike dissolves like.â€ That is, a polar solute dissolves in a polar solvent, and a non-polar solute dissolves in a non-polar solvent.
Therefore, polar or ionic molecules like sugar and sodium chloride dissolve in water molecules, which are polar, while non-polar molecules like naphthalene and anthracene dissolve in solvents like benzene and carbon tetrachloride, which are non-polar.  
This behaviour can be explained in terms of the interaction between particles of the solute and the solvent. 
The solubility of ionic compounds is the result of the strong electrostatic interaction between the ions of the solute and the polar molecules of the solvent.

The solubility of non-polar solutes is the result of similar solute-solute, solute-solvent and solvent-solvent interactions. 
When a solid solute is added to a solvent, its concentration in the solution increases.  This process is known as dissolution.
