This saturates the soil for cultivation.\nOne of the most widely used methods of collecting rain water is rooftop rainwater harvesting.\nIn a rooftop rainwater harvesting system, rain water falling on the roof is collected and then filtered before being stored in tanks for immediate use. Excess water is diverted to wells to recharge groundwater.\nIn many parts of Rajasthan, rain water collected through rooftop harvesting is collected in large underground reservoirs, called tankas.\nAlmost all households in Shillong in Meghalaya use rooftop rainwater harvesting to meet almost 20 percent of their total requirement of water.\nEach of the 200 households in Gendathur, Karnataka, that adopted rooftop rainwater harvesting can collect 50,000 litres of rain water every year for its use.\nIn bamboo drip irrigation, shallow channels are made from split bamboos, which are used to divert water from rain-fed springs to the farmers. Channel sections are used in the farm to water the plants. \n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd\n\nLearnNext is an interactive, computer-based self-learning solution which helps students retain concepts better and perfect them with exhaustive practice and tests.

What is water scarcity. The unavailability of sufficient clean water to meet personal, domestic and industrial requirements in an area is called water scarcity. We usually associate the problem of water scarcity with dry, hot regions like desserts that receives scanty rainfall and have very few celsus of clean surface water. Here is a map that shows projected water scarcity in the world by the year two thousand twenty five As you can see water scarcity is said to become a serious problem in the whole of India. Not all regions that face water scarcity have poor water resources. What leads to water scarcity in regions that have abundant water resources. An increase in demand, unequal access to water, overexploitation and contamination of existing water resources are the main factors that lead to water scarcity in regions with abundant water resources. Let us study these factors in detail. This brings us to the question what are the main causes of water scarcity? India has a second highest population in the world which is still increasing fast. An increase in population means a greater demand for fresh water for personal and domestic use. To feed the increasing population more and more land is brought under cultivation. \nThis also increases the demand for water for irrigation purposes. Six independence India has seen a major industrial revolution, rapid industrialisation exerts greater demand on water resources. Since industries use a huge quantity of water for production and cleaning. Over seventy percent of India's population still lives in villages. However people living in cities have better access to water than people living in most villages. This unequal access to water resources also leads to water scarcity. Groundwater is an important freshwater resource. However in order to increase their produce most farmers today use private tube-wells to irrigate their fields. This over exploitation of underground water is leading to falling water table and water scarcity. Similarly the use of bore-wells by modern housing societies to provide water to their residents is also over-exploitation of underground water resources. Fresh water resources like rivers and lakes are often treated as dumping round for domestic use and industrial waste. This pollutes the fresh water and makes it unfit for our use. Such contamination of fresh water also contributes to water scarcity. The use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides in modern agriculture leads to pollution of fresh surface water and groundwater. \n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd\n\nLearnNext is an interactive, computer-based self-learning solution which helps students retain concepts better and perfect them with exhaustive practice and tests.

Primitive subsistence farming:\nInvolves cultivating food crops in small fields essentially to sustain the farmer\u2019s family. Depends entirely on local soil and environment conditions and monsoons. Involves hard manual labour. Is slash-and-burn agriculture. Allows the soil to regain its fertility naturally.\nGives very poor yield and leads to a large-scale destruction of forests Besides India, slash-and-burn or shifting cultivation is practiced in many parts of the world and known by different names. In India, the most popular name for such shifting cultivation is Jhumming, by which it is known in many of our north-eastern states. Intensive subsistence farming:: Is practised in densely populated areas of India\nAims to get maximum yield from the available land through extensive irrigation and use of large quantities of chemical fertilisers. Repeated division of land amongst successive generations of farmers decreases individual land holding, further encouraging farmers to use all available means to increase yield. Commercial farming: Involves the cultivation of a crop in large quantities for the purpose of selling it in the market Uses high yielding seeds, chemical fertilisers and pesticides Plantations are also forms of commercial farming.

the textile industry.\nCotton, woollen and silk are the main types of textiles produced in India.\nIndia\u2019s textile industry is completely self-reliant in terms of raw material and technology to produce finished garments from raw fibre.\nAt present, there are around 16,000 cotton textile mills in India.\nThe cotton textile industry supports people in a number of jobs, like farmers, cotton pickers, and workers engaged in ginning, spinning, weaving, dyeing, designing, packaging and tailoring.\nIn its modern form, the cotton textile industry started developing in India in the cotton growing regions of Maharashtra and Gujarat.\nThe cotton yarn spinning industry is still concentrated in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, while the weaving industry is spread over several parts of India.\nIndia holds 25 percent share in the world market of cotton yarn, but only 4 percent in cotton garments.\nMost industries in the weaving sector produce poor quality fabric for local markets.\nIndia exports high-quality cotton yarn, but imports good quality cotton fabric.\nThe main challenges faced by the cotton textile industry in India are:\nNeed to import raw cotton to use the spinning capacity.\nUnreliable supply of power.\nLow output of labour.\nNeed to upgrade machinery.\nCompetition from the synthetic fibre industry.\nIndia is the world\u2019s largest producer of raw jute. \nIndia is the second largest exporter or raw jute and jute products in the world after Bangladesh. \nIndia has around 70 jute mills, most of which are located in West Bengal along the Hugli river. \nThe main challenges faced by the jute industry in India are:\nCompetition from synthetic substitutes.\nCompetition from other jute manufacturing countries like Bangladesh, Brazil, Egypt, Philippines and Thailand.\nThe National Jute Policy was formulated in 2005 to:\nIncrease productivity \nImprove quality\nProvide better rates for jute to farmers\nIncrease the yield of jute per hectare\nJute products are biodegradable and environment friendly. \nIndia is the largest producer of Gur and Khandsari, and the second largest producer of sugar in the world.\nThe sugar industry is a

Class 10 | Geography | Industrial Pollution & Environmental Degradation |","description":"In this module, you will learn about Industrial Pollution & Environmental Degradation, Industrialisation has caused severe pollution of our natural resources.\nIndustries cause environmental degradation through:\nAir pollution\nWater pollution\nLand pollution or soil degradation\nNoise pollution\nSmoke contains undesirable gases like carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide, besides solid and liquid particulate matter in the form of dust and spray mist that cause air pollution.\nAir pollution affects the health of humans, animals and plants alike, and also causes damage to buildings.\nWater pollution is caused by the discharge of untreated chemical waste, heavy metals like lead and mercury, pesticides, fertilisers and plastics from industries, into fresh water bodies like rivers and lakes.\nSolid wastes like fly ash, phospo-gypsum, iron and steel slag also cause water pollution.\nThe industries that cause major amount of water pollution are paper and pulp industries, oil refineries, tanneries, and electroplating industries.\nThe discharge of hot water from thermal power plants into rivers before cooling is called thermal pollution of water.\nRadioactive waste, hazardous chemicals, glass, plastic, industrial effluents and non-biodegradable garbage are the main agents of land pollution.\nRain water falling on polluted land dissolves and carries many pollutants further into the ground and pollutes groundwater.\nIndustrial machinery, construction activities, generators, and equipment like saws and pneumatic drills, are mainly responsible for noise pollution. \nLoud noise can lead to irritation, loss of hearing, and an increase in the blood pressure and heart rate.\nPolluted wastewater from industries must be treated before releasing it into water bodies.\nWastewater treatment involves:\nPrimary treatment through screening, grinding, flocculation and sedimentation\nSecondary treatment through bacterial action to digest harmful chemicals\nTertiary stage of stirring with chemicals to neutralise remaining harmful waste\nTreated wastewater can be recycled for reuse in industrial processes.\nRainwater harvesting can be used to meet the requirements of water for industrial processes.\nLegal provisions must be made to regulate the use of groundwater for industrial use.\nSmoke stacks, filters, scrubbers, and electrostatic and inertial separators remove a large amount of harmful particles from industrial smoke.\nThe emission of smoke
