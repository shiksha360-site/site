In this module, you will learn about three-dimensional shapes and the concept of nets. 
Figures such as squares, rectangles, triangles and circles are called two-dimensional figures. 
These figures have only two dimensions, length, and breadth. 
Two-dimensional figures can be combined to form three dimensional shapes. 
For example, six squares can be combined to form a cube. 
Likewise, three parallelograms and two triangles can be combined to form a triangular prism. 
Some of the three-dimensional shapes we encounter in our daily life are balls, ice cream cones, food tins and dice. 
Three-dimensional shapes as the name suggests will have three dimensions, length, breadth and height. 

Sometimes the height is also called as depth. 
For any solid shape, the surface may be curved or flat or a combination of two. 
For a cube, the surfaces are all flat.
The flat surface of a three-dimensional shape is called a face.
