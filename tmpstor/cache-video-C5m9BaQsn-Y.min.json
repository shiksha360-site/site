Let us see how the movement takes place in some of the smaller animals.\n \nHow does an earthworm move?\n\nEarthworm\u2019s body secretes a slimy substance that helps it to move. The tiny stiff hair-like projections, called bristles, under their body help them to grab the soil. \nThey first stretch out and then contract the muscles to move. \nThey draw out the front part of their body, keeping the back fixed to the ground. And, then they release the back portion keeping the front part fixed. Hence, they cover only a small distance with every move.\nThey can move with ease on a hard and slippery surface.\n.The intestine throws away undigested matter as small pellets into the soil. This improves the quality of the soil for plants.\nAnimation/Graphic Type: 2D/3D\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\n\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C5m9BaQsn-Y/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C5m9BaQsn-Y/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C5m9BaQsn-Y/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C5m9BaQsn-Y/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"LearnNext","tags":["class 6","cbse class 6","class 6 science","science videos","body movements"],"categoryId":"27","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"Class 6 | Science | Body Movements | Gait of Animals","description":"Class 6 | Science | Body Movements | Gait of Animals\n\nIn this module, you will learn about the gait of animals.\n\nThe body movements are possible in humans because of several bones and joints.
