In this module, you will learn how to add and subtract fractions.

There are two cans of milk. There is 1 to 5 litres of milk in one and 2 to 5 litres of milk in the second. 
What is the total quantity of milk
Both these fractions have the same number in the denominator, so they are like fractions.
When two like fractions are added, their sum will be a fraction with the same denominator.
So, here the denominator of the sum will also be 5.
The numerator of the sum will be equal to the sum of the numerators of the fraction.
Here, we will add the numerators 1 and 2. We get 3, which is the numerator of the sum.
Now use the common denominator of the like fractions as the denominator in the resultant fraction. 
Here, the denominator is five.
