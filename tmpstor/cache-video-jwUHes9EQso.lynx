Anne wants to buy burgers, chocolate pastries, and fruit juices to serve at her brotherâ€™s birthday party.
She has a fixed budget of seven hundred and fifty rupees for eatables.
How many children can she invite to the party?
A burger costs 15 rupees, a chocolate pastry costs 20 rupees and a can of fruit juice costs 15 rupees.
Thus, the total cost of eatables for one child will be 50 rupees. The cost for two children will be 100 rupees, for three children will be 150 rupees, and so on.
Letâ€™s assume that the number of children attending the party is n. 
The total amount required for the eatables will be 50 multiplied by n rupees.
