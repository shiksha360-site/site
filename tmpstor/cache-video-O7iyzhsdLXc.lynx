In this module, you will learn about the associative property of integers under addition.
Take a look at this problem. Letâ€™s try and prove this property with the help of the number line.
First, we represent the sum on the number line.
Now we represent the second sum on the number line to check the final result. 
As you can see, the result in both the cases is the same - that is minus nine.
The example shows us that we can either add "minus three and minus two" together and then add that sum to minus four to get the final answer, 
or we can add "minus four and minus three" together first and then add that sum to minus two to get the final answer. 
The answer will be the same, no matter which way we do it.
This shows that addition is associative for integers.
Hence, 
for any integers a, b and c, we have
a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c.
