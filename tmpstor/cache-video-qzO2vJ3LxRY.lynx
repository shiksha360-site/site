The water that is found above the earth in the form of cloud and below the earth as ground water together forms hydrosphere . Hydrosphere constitutes 75% of the Earthâ€™s surface.
In this module, you learned that:
â€¢ The land, the water and the air are the natural resources available on the Earth.
â€¢ The solid outermost layer of the Earthâ€™s crust and the rigid upper part of its mantle is called the lithosphere.
â€¢ The Earthâ€™s surface, above it as clouds and below it as ground water is called the hydrosphere.
â€¢ The air that covers the Earth like a blanket is called the atmosphere.
â€¢ The region where the atmosphere, the hydrosphere and the lithosphere interact and supports life is called the biosphere.
â€¢ The biosphere has two components: biotic and abiotic.
â€¢  Living organisms constitute the biotic component of the biosphere.
â€¢ The air, the water and the soil constitute the abiotic component of the biosphere.
