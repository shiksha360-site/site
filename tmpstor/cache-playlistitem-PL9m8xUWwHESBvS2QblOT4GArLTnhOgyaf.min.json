They carry along with them a certain amount of energy and information in the form of signals.\nLet us consider an example, Where a pebble is thrown into a pond of still water. We see ripples of waves are formed at the place where the pebble touches the surface of water and moving outward in circles. A dry leaf on the surface of the water is seen moving up and down in its place. This shows that the water does not move along with the wave.\nThis disturbance in the medium that is water, is transmitted from particle to its adjoining particle is due to the elastic forces binding them.\nNow let us look at various other examples where waves propagate through other media. \nIn today\u2019s\u2019 world that we live in, communication systems play a vital role. These communication systems involve transmission of waves to send and receive information.\n\nFor example while communicating through a telephone; the sound waves produced by the vocal cords are converted into electrical waves or signals at the source. These electrical signals can be processed in different ways to reach the receiving end. These electrical signals may be:\n\n\u2022 Transmitted through a copper cable.\n\u2022 Converted into light signals and then transmitted through optical cables \n\u2022 Converted into electromagnetic waves and then transmitted through air or communication satellites.\n\nThe received signals are converted back to sound waves by the instrument at the receiving end.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\n\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wdj7Xe7T1WQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wdj7Xe7T1WQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wdj7Xe7T1WQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wdj7Xe7T1WQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wdj7Xe7T1WQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"LearnNext","playlistId":"PL9m8xUWwHESBvS2QblOT4GArLTnhOgyaf","position":0,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Wdj7Xe7T1WQ"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"LearnNext","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"Wdj7Xe7T1WQ","videoPublishedAt":"2018-04-02T13:24:20Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"ZYengb6RLXrdElH5uic70uSn22Q","id":"UEw5bTh4VVd3SEVTQnZTMlFibE9UNEdBckxUbmhPZ3lhZi4yODlGNEE0NkRGMEEzMEQy","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-05T09:59:20Z","channelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw","title":"Class 11 Physics Chapter 8 Gravitation | Keplers Laws","description":"Class 11 Physics Keplers Laws\n\nIn this module, you will learn about Kepler\u2019s laws of planetary motion.

Before we begin, let\u2019s look at examples of some common chemical reactions like the burning of coal. When coal is burnt, the chemical energy stored in the molecules is released as heat or thermal energy. \n\nAnother example is that of a car. While driving, igniting the car engine causes the fuel to burn and convert the chemical energy to mechanical energy, propelling the car to move along the road. \n\nIn both the examples, chemical energy, that is the energy stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules, is converted to other forms of energy. \n\nThus, various forms of energy are interrelated and under certain conditions, these may be transformed from one form to another.\n\nThe branch of science that deals with the study of different forms of energy and the quantitative relationship between them is known as thermodynamics. \n\nThe term thermodynamics is derived from the Greek word, `Thermos', meaning heat and `dynamics', meaning flow. \n\nIt was coined by James Joule in the early 19th century. Thermodynamics deals with the energy changes within a system. \n\nA system in thermodynamics refers to that part of the universe in which observations are made. \n\nFor example, the tea in the teapot is a system. The part of the universe that is not a part of the system but can interact with the system is called a surrounding. In this case, the room in which the teapot is kept is the surrounding. Systems and surroundings together constitute the universe. \n\nThe part that separates a system from its surrounding is known as a boundary. In this case, the wall of the teapot is the boundary. \n\nNote that, a boundary can be real or imaginary and it controls the flow of energy into the system or out of the system. \n\nIn thermodynamics, based on the movements of matter and energy between a system and its surroundings, systems can be classified into three types. \n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\n\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FdpzVd-yWMM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FdpzVd-yWMM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FdpzVd-yWMM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FdpzVd-yWMM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FdpzVd-yWMM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"LearnNext","playlistId":"PL9m8xUWwHESBvS2QblOT4GArLTnhOgyaf","position":5,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"FdpzVd-yWMM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"LearnNext","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"FdpzVd-yWMM","videoPublishedAt":"2018-03-29T08:29:08Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"L4GyXw3gjrexCSiYhuXZHo585WY","id":"UEw5bTh4VVd3SEVTQnZTMlFibE9UNEdBckxUbmhPZ3lhZi41MzJCQjBCNDIyRkJDN0VD","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-05T10:12:42Z","channelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw","title":"Class 11 Chemistry Chapter 2 Structure of Atom | Atomic Models","description":"Class 11 Chemistry Atomic Models\n\nIn this module, you will learn about the various  atomic models.\nThrough various experiments, it was established that an atom consists of some  subatomic particles such as protons, electrons and neutrons. Now, let us look at the arrangement of these sub atomic particles in an atom. Different models were proposed to explain the distribution of sub atomic particles in an atom. Of these models, the models proposed by J.J. Thomson and Ernest Rutherford are of great significance as they paved the way for modern structure of an atom.. Let\u2019s discuss  both these models one by one. J.J. Thomson,  in 1898, proposed the atomic model called Thomson\u2019s atomic model soon after the discovery of electrons. According to this model, an atom is a sphere consisting of uniformly spread  mass of positive charge with negatively-charged particles called electrons embedded in it. In this model, the  negatively charged particles that are embedded in evenly spread positive charge  can be visualised as  plums or raisins or seeds that are embedded  in a pudding or watermelon. Therefore, this model is also called plum pudding, raisin pudding or watermelon model.\nAlthough this model successfully explained the overall neutrality of the atom it could not explain the results of the scattering experiment conducted by Ernest Rutherford . Also it couldn\u2019t explain the stability of an atom, that is, how the positively charged particles are shielded from the negatively charged particles without getting neutralised.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GKhhbhTjStY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GKhhbhTjStY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GKhhbhTjStY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GKhhbhTjStY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GKhhbhTjStY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"LearnNext","playlistId":"PL9m8xUWwHESBvS2QblOT4GArLTnhOgyaf","position":6,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"GKhhbhTjStY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"LearnNext","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"GKhhbhTjStY","videoPublishedAt":"2018-03-29T08:29:08Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"NehRsHIKawKOSx1vHH8mED7SLYE","id":"UEw5bTh4VVd3SEVTQnZTMlFibE9UNEdBckxUbmhPZ3lhZi5DQUNERDQ2NkIzRUQxNTY1","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-05T10:14:28Z","channelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw","title":"Class 11 Chemistry Chapter 11 Organic Chemistry | Introduction and Vital Force Theory","description":"Class 11 Chemistry Introduction And Vital Force Theory\n\nIn this module, you will be introduced to organic chemistry. \nCarbon is an essential element of all organic compounds.

Level of the organization is the first basic fundamental feature that deals with the pattern of cell organization in an animal.\nThere are four patterns of cell organization: cellular, tissue, organ and organ system. \nSponges exhibit a cellular level of organization, where cells are loosely arranged. \nTissue level of organization is more complex and is displayed in coelenterates. Here, the cells that perform the same function are arranged into tissues.\nOrgan level of organization is exhibited in members of Platyhelminthes and other higher phyla. Here, the tissues are grouped to form organs and each organ performs a particular function.\nThe last cell pattern is the organ system level of organization. Here, the organs are associated with one another to form a functional system where each system performs a specific physiological function. Animals like annelids, arthropods, molluscs, echinoderms, and chordates exhibit this level of organization.

Plants utilize only a small amount of food for oxidation and the rest is used in building their body in the form of cellulose.\nFurther, the demand for oxygen is supplied during photosynthesis, where oxygen is an end product.\nPlants respire through small openings called the stomata on leaves and lenticels on stems and roots.\nUnlike animals, each part of the plant takes care of its oxygen needs.\nPlants respire at a slower rate as compared to animals.\nIn the woody stems, the living cells are present close to the surface and aid in the diffusion of gases.\nDiffusion of gases is also facilitated by the presence of loosely arranged parenchyma cells that provide air spaces.\nNext, to respiration, the requirement of food becomes an important thing for survival.\nHumans and animals are heterotrophs in the sense that they obtain food from plants and other animals.\nSaprophytes like bacteria and some fungi feed on dead organisms.\nGreen plants and cyanobacteria are the only organisms that can synthesize their own food using photosynthesis.\nThey are the food source of the world as animals either directly or indirectly depend on them for food.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\n\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CYoj4kO4o2A/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CYoj4kO4o2A/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CYoj4kO4o2A/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CYoj4kO4o2A/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CYoj4kO4o2A/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"LearnNext","playlistId":"PL9m8xUWwHESBvS2QblOT4GArLTnhOgyaf","position":9,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"CYoj4kO4o2A"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"LearnNext","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"CYoj4kO4o2A","videoPublishedAt":"2018-03-29T08:29:08Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"4CAZ1Qn4HHg4zRzjrGHcjz21oh8","id":"UEw5bTh4VVd3SEVTQnZTMlFibE9UNEdBckxUbmhPZ3lhZi40NzZCMERDMjVEN0RFRThB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-05T10:20:39Z","channelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw","title":"Class 11 Biology Chapter 3 Plant Kingdom | Algae","description":"Class 11 Biology Algae\n\nIn this module, you will learn about algae. \n\nYou must have often seen a slimy green layer on rocks lying close to the sea. This green layer is algae. These are simple, thalloid, chlorophyll-bearing autotrophic organisms. You can spot algae growing on moist rocks and stones, in marine and fresh water, and wood. \nAlgae come in different forms and sizes. For instance, Chlamydomonas is unicellular, whereas Volvox is of colonial form and Spirogyra is filamentous. On the other hand, kelps form massive plant bodies.\nAlgae reproduce through vegetative, asexual and sexual methods. \nVegetative reproduction occurs by the process of \u201cfragmentation,\u201d wherein each fragment develops into a thallus, while asexual reproduction takes place through spores like zoospores. These spores are flagellated and germinate into new plants. \n\nDuring sexual reproduction, two gametes fuse to form a new organism. \n\nBased on the size of the gametes, sexual reproduction can be further divided into isogamous, anisogamous and oogamous reproduction. \n\nWhen the fusion is between two gametes of similar size, the reproduction is called isogamous. The gametes, in this case, can be flagellated as in Chlamydomonas or non-flagellated as in Spirogyra. \nWhen fusion takes place between two gametes of dissimilar size, the reproduction is termed as anisogamous. \nOogamus is a fusion between a large, non-motile female gamete and a small, motile male gamete. \n\nAlgae perform a wide variety of functions.

This depends upon the relation between the direction of displacement of the particles in the medium and the direction of the propagation of the disturbance or the wave.\nIn a transverse wave the particles of the medium vibrate in a direction normal to the direction of the propagation of the wave. \n\nIn a longitudinal wave the particles of the medium vibrate in a direction parallel to the direction of the propagation of the wave.\n\nIn both the waves it is the disturbance that propagates and not the particles of the medium. The particles of the medium only vibrate about their mean positions.\nLet us conduct an experiment to understand how a transverse wave is produced and propagated.\n\nLet us first fix one of the ends of a string of length say 2 meters to a pole. Hold the free end of the string tight so that the string is in tension. Now give a jerk to the string by moving the hand up and bring it back to the initial position.\nThe pulse that is created by the jerk traverses through the string to the fixed end. The movement of the pulse through the string can be compared to the movement of a caterpillar.\nThe pulse that traverses through the string moves with a certain velocity v.\nNext when the hand is moved up and down about a mean position with a simple harmonic motion, a continuous wave which is sinusoidal in shape travels along the string with a velocity v. \n\nThere are two ways of studying the wave formed in this process.\nThe first one is by taking a snap shot of the string while the waves are travelling through it.\nThe other method is that we mark a point on the string and observe as the waves propagate through the string. We see that the point marked moves up and down the mean position.\n\nThe wave form that is observed in this process is a transverse wave.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\n\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ATGDOgNqW2g/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ATGDOgNqW2g/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ATGDOgNqW2g/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ATGDOgNqW2g/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ATGDOgNqW2g/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"LearnNext","playlistId":"PL9m8xUWwHESBvS2QblOT4GArLTnhOgyaf","position":18,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ATGDOgNqW2g"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"LearnNext","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"ATGDOgNqW2g","videoPublishedAt":"2018-04-25T08:09:24Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"WgQtyHpW0WBB6BpOYvj9PYgS7vk","id":"UEw5bTh4VVd3SEVTQnZTMlFibE9UNEdBckxUbmhPZ3lhZi5ENDU4Q0M4RDExNzM1Mjcy","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-25T08:13:11Z","channelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw","title":"Class 11 | Physics | Laws of Motion | Newton's First Law of Motion","description":"Class 11 | Physics | Laws of Motion | Newton's First Law of Motion\n\nIn this module, you will learn about Newton\u2019s First Law of Motion. \nNewton\u2019s Laws of Motion have their roots in Galileo\u2019s Law of Inertia. \nIn fact, Newton\u2019s First Law of Motion is almost the same as Galileo\u2019s Law of Inertia. \nNewton\u2019s First Law of Motion states that: \u201cEvery object continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled by some external force to act otherwise.\u201d \nIf you observe, there is no mention of acceleration in Newton\u2019s First Law of Motion.\nThis is because, when a body is in a state of rest, it has no acceleration. \nSimilarly, a body in uniform motion in a straight line does not accelerate. \nBased on these facts, we can express Newton\u2019s First Law of Motion in two more very useful forms. One: if the net external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero and vice-versa. \nTwo: \u201cA body accelerates only when a net external force acts on it.\u201d These two forms of the law are extensively used while solving problems in kinetics. \n\nTo Watch more Class 11 Physics Videos.\n\nVisit: https://www.learnnext.com/CBSE/Class-11.htm#\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S1wSQk18tkw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S1wSQk18tkw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S1wSQk18tkw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S1wSQk18tkw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S1wSQk18tkw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"LearnNext","playlistId":"PL9m8xUWwHESBvS2QblOT4GArLTnhOgyaf","position":19,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"S1wSQk18tkw"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"LearnNext","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"S1wSQk18tkw","videoPublishedAt":"2018-04-25T08:13:09Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"59J_LUzSYvh1K7A_0j2NHFfcIro","id":"UEw5bTh4VVd3SEVTQnZTMlFibE9UNEdBckxUbmhPZ3lhZi4yMDhBMkNBNjRDMjQxQTg1","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-25T06:51:13Z","channelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw","title":"Testimonial : LearnNext User who secured 95% in XII CBSE final exams","description":"Congratulations to Mr. Pranav a user from LearnNext who secured 95% in his class  XII CBSE final exams.\n\nLearnNext is an interactive, computer-based self-learning solution which helps students retain concepts better and perfect them with exhaustive practice and tests.
