In this module, you will learn how to create symmetrical patterns.

One half of a figure along with its line of symmetry is given. 
Let us see how we can create the other half with the help of the line of symmetry.
We will use a squared paper to complete this figure.

We have to consider each part of the given figure and draw its corresponding part on the other side of the line of symmetry.
For example, the horizontal line in the given figure extends for a width of two squares on the squared paper from the line of symmetry. 
So, we draw a similar line to the left of the given line of symmetry, as shown.
Next, look at the slanting line in the given figure. 
The slanting line is a diagonal of the third square to the right of the line of symmetry.
So, we draw a similar line to the left of the given line of symmetry, as shown.
This completes the given figure along the vertical line of symmetry. 
Note that each part of the constructed figure is equal in measurement to its corresponding part.
