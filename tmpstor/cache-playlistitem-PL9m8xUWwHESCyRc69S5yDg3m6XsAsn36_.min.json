Use of renewable resources faster than what nature can restore can lead to their scarcity.

More people engaged in agriculture than required leads to underemployment or disguised unemployment. The surplus workers could be employed more gainfully elsewhere. Many workers in the manufacturing and services sectors suffer from underemployment. More employment opportunities can be generated by:\nImproving rural infrastructure\nProviding easy, affordable loans to farmers\nPromoting rural industries\nExpanding education and healthcare services\nPromoting tourism \nProperly implementing employment generation schemes like NREGA\nThe National Rural Employment Guarantee Act was implemented by the Central government in 2005.

The final values of goods are used to calculate the production in a sector. The sum of the total production in the three sectors in a year for a country gives the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for that country in that year. GDP is a globally accepted indicator of the size and health of a country\u2019s economy. The contribution of different sectors to the GDP of a country depends on the state of development of that country\u2019s economy. At the initial stage of development, the primary sector is the biggest contributor to GDP. In a developing economy, the secondary sector becomes the biggest contributor to GDP. In developed countries, the tertiary sector is the biggest contributor to GDP. The tertiary sector has become the largest sector of India\u2019s economy.

Poor households in India largely depend on the informal sector for credit. Banks demand collateral against a loan that poor people cannot provide. The members of a self-help group save regularly to create a savings pool. Members of the group can take small loans from their combined savings. The loans bear interest at low rates. After saving regularly for a few years, a self-help group becomes eligible for a bank loan without collateral. The loan is used to generate more income and employment opportunities. The members of a self-help group make all the decisions jointly and are jointly responsible for the repayment of loans. Banks also extend loans to poor women organised in self-help groups. Self-help groups allow poor people access to affordable, easy credit.\nThe Grameen Bank of Bangladesh is a brilliant example of meeting credit needs of the poor at affordable rates.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd\n\nLearnNext is an interactive, computer-based self-learning solution which helps students retain concepts better and perfect them with exhaustive practice and tests.
