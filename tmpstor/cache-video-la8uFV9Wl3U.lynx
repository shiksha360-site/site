Consider a weighing scale. One pan has four kilograms weight in it and the other has two kilograms.

To balance the scale, two kilograms are added to the left pan and four kilograms are added to the right pan.
Now, the scale is balanced. This means that the sum of four and two kilograms is equal to the sum of two and four kilograms, which is equal to six kilograms. 

In this module, you will learn to frame rules from arithmetic.

Letâ€™s look at another example. The right pan has five kilograms and the left pan has three kilograms.
To balance the scale, three kilograms are added to the right pan and five kilograms to the left pan. 
This means that the sum of three and five kilograms is equal to the sum of five and three kilograms, which is equal to eight kilograms. 
This property of numbers is called commutativity of addition.
