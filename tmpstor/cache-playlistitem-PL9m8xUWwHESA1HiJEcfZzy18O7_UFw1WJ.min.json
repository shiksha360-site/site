Let\u2019s learn about these properties one by one.  \nThe first property states that the process of differentiation and integration are inverses of each other.  That is, the derivative of integral of (f of x) with respect to x is equal to (f of x), and the integral of the derivative of (f of x) with respect to x is equal to (f of x) plus C, where C is any arbitrary constant.  \nLet\u2019s see the proof for this property.  \nLet G be any anti derivative of f, that is,\n(d by dx) of (G of x) is equal to (f of x).  Let\u2019s take this as equation one.  \nThen, integral of (f of x) with respect to x is equal to (G of x) plus C,  where C is a constant of integration.  \nNow, on differentiating both the sides with respect to x, we get derivative of integral of (f of x) dx is equal to derivative of (G of x) plus C.  \nSince the derivative of a constant is equal to zero, so we get (d by dx) (G of x), which is equal to (f of x) from equation (1).   \nTherefore, derivative of integral of (f of x) dx is equal to (f of x). \nNow, let\u2019s prove that integral of derivative of (f of x) with respect to x is equal to (f of x) plus C.\nWe know that the derivative of (f of x) can be written as f- dash of x.  So, the integral of derivative of (f of x) with respect to x can also be written as integral of (f \u2013 dash of x) with respect to x.    \n\nAnd, integral of (f \u2013 dash of x) into dx is equal to (f of x) plus C.  Here, C is called the constant of integration.  \nLet\u2019s evaluate the derivative of integral of one by (one plus x \u2013 square) dx ... by using this property.\nWe know that integral of (one by one plus x \u2013 square) into dx is equal to tan \u2013 inverse x plus C, where C is the integration constant.  \n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\n\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x4LN7u-ai9c/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x4LN7u-ai9c/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x4LN7u-ai9c/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x4LN7u-ai9c/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x4LN7u-ai9c/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"LearnNext","playlistId":"PL9m8xUWwHESA1HiJEcfZzy18O7_UFw1WJ","position":5,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"x4LN7u-ai9c"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"LearnNext","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"x4LN7u-ai9c","videoPublishedAt":"2018-04-03T11:55:05Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"mUeT9XGAp44_GN7xChuJ8KLRTzk","id":"UEw5bTh4VVd3SEVTQTFIaUpFY2ZaenkxOE83X1VGdzFXSi41MzJCQjBCNDIyRkJDN0VD","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-05T09:34:10Z","channelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw","title":"Class 12 | Maths | Differential Equations | Forming Differential Equations","description":"Class 12 | Maths | Differential Equations | Forming Differential Equations\n\nGiven a general solution, let\u2019s learn to build a differential equation out of it.\nLet\u2019s assume that the function, (x into y) is equal to (a x square) plus (b upon x), ... is the general solution of a differential equation. \nLet\u2019s find the differential equation. \nObserve the equation carefully.

Hence, it depends on the nature of the solute and the solvent, as well as on the temperature and pressure. However, note that the solubility of solids in liquids is independent of pressure.\nLet us first discuss the solubility of solids in liquids. \nThe solubility of solids in liquids depends upon two factors, namely the nature of the solute and solvent, and the temperature. Let\u2019s discuss how solubility depends on the nature of the solute and solvent.\nIt is observed that while sodium chloride and sugar dissolve readily in water, naphthalene and anthracene do not.\nIn general, solubility follows the rule \u201clike dissolves like.\u201d That is, a polar solute dissolves in a polar solvent, and a non-polar solute dissolves in a non-polar solvent.\nTherefore, polar or ionic molecules like sugar and sodium chloride dissolve in water molecules, which are polar, while non-polar molecules like naphthalene and anthracene dissolve in solvents like benzene and carbon tetrachloride, which are non-polar.  \nThis behaviour can be explained in terms of the interaction between particles of the solute and the solvent. \nThe solubility of ionic compounds is the result of the strong electrostatic interaction between the ions of the solute and the polar molecules of the solvent.\n\nThe solubility of non-polar solutes is the result of similar solute-solute, solute-solvent and solvent-solvent interactions. \nWhen a solid solute is added to a solvent, its concentration in the solution increases.

You will also learn about the methods to prepare some important condensation polymers, as well as their uses. \nIn condensation polymerisation, the molecules of a monomer combined with the elimination of simple molecules such as water, alcohol, and ammonia to form a polymer. The polymer so formed is called a condensation polymer. \nYou already know that condensation polymers are the result of repeated condensation reactions between two different bi-functional monomers. Hence, this type of polymerisation also involves a series of reactions, just as in addition polymerisation, but it differs in the aspect that each step is independent of the preceding one.  The series of reactions in condensation polymerisation is attributed to the presence of more than one functional group in the monomer. In other words, the formation of a polymer is possible as the monomer can undergo reaction at more than one functional group. \nThe product formed in each step of the reaction, as a result of condensation between two different bi-functional monomers, also has a bi-functional group that can further react with another monomer to form a larger molecule. The series of such reactions continue. The step-wise condensation of monomers, which results in the formation of a polymer, is called step growth polymerisation.\nIllustrated here is the condensation reaction between ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid to form polyethylene terephthalate, - PET  also known as  Dacron. Note that in each step, when two different monomers combine, a water molecule is eliminated.\nLet us now see how some important condensation polymers are prepared, and their uses. \n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\n\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lsQO7SK5SkY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lsQO7SK5SkY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lsQO7SK5SkY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lsQO7SK5SkY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"LearnNext","playlistId":"PL9m8xUWwHESA1HiJEcfZzy18O7_UFw1WJ","position":8,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"lsQO7SK5SkY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"LearnNext","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"lsQO7SK5SkY","videoPublishedAt":"2018-04-03T12:23:19Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"jI48AXInvyEEOTjX50b4MsPFZAY","id":"UEw5bTh4VVd3SEVTQTFIaUpFY2ZaenkxOE83X1VGdzFXSi5GNjNDRDREMDQxOThCMDQ2","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-05T09:54:03Z","channelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw","title":"Class 12 | Chemistry | Alcohols, Phenol's and Ether's","description":"Class 12 | Chemistry | Alcohols, Phenol's and Ether's | Physical Properties\n\nIn this module, you will learn about the physical properties of alcohols and phenols.\nAlcohols and phenols consist of two main parts: an alkyl or aryl group, and a hydroxyl group.\nThe hydroxyl group chiefly determines the physical properties of the alcohols and phenols. The nature of the alkyl or aryl group does modify these properties to some extent.\nThe boiling points of both, alcohols and phenols, increase as the length of the carbon chain increases, as shown in the table here for some primary alcohols. This is due to increasingly strong London forces as the length of the carbon chains increase.\nWhat is the effect of branching on the boiling point of alcohols? Use the information in the table.\nThe table shows three butanol isomers, which all have the same molecular formula. As the branching of the carbon chain increases, the molecules attain a spherical shape and thus the surface area decreases. As a result, the van der Walls forces of attraction become weaker, and, therefore, the boiling point decreases with an increase in branching. \nTherefore, among the isomers of butanol, tertiary butyl alcohol ( 2 methyl  prop 2 ol)  has the lowest boiling point, as shown in the table\nAlcohols and phenols have higher boiling points higher than other classes of organic molecules, such as hydrocarbons, ethers, haloalkanes and haloarenes, with similar molecular masses.\nFor example, the boiling point of ethanol is considerably higher than that of methoxymethane or propane, although all the three substances have very similar molecular masses.\nBoth alcohols and phenols can participate in intermolecular hydrogen bonds due to the presence of the polar hydroxyl group. Thus, alcohols and phenols have higher boiling points than ethers or hydrocarbons, which cannot participate in hydrogen bonding.\nAlcohols and phenol can both form hydrogen bonds with water, and so both are water-soluble. The solubility of other phenols is very low in comparison to phenol. It should be noted, however, that as the alkyl or aryl groups get larger, the solubility decreases.\n\nEthanol and other low molecular mass alcohols are completely miscible in water\u2014they can dissolve in water in any proportion. \n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\n\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DlmTDWYg06k/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DlmTDWYg06k/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DlmTDWYg06k/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DlmTDWYg06k/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DlmTDWYg06k/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"LearnNext","playlistId":"PL9m8xUWwHESA1HiJEcfZzy18O7_UFw1WJ","position":9,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"DlmTDWYg06k"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"LearnNext","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"DlmTDWYg06k","videoPublishedAt":"2018-04-03T12:22:01Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"JzuhG0N-IBKHsSzCg0zOjvVJZUA","id":"UEw5bTh4VVd3SEVTQTFIaUpFY2ZaenkxOE83X1VGdzFXSi40NzZCMERDMjVEN0RFRThB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-05T09:54:45Z","channelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw","title":"Class 12 | Biology | Human Reproduction | Female Reproductive System","description":"Class 12 | Biology | Human Reproduction | Female Reproductive System\n\nThe female reproductive system includes the ovaries, oviducts, uterus, cervix, vagina and the external genitalia located in the pelvic region. The female accessory ducts include the oviducts, uterus and the vagina. It supports the process of ovulation, fertilisation, pregnancy, childbirth and child care.   \n\nThe uterus is a hollow pear-shaped muscular organ and is highly distensible. The female external genitalia is called the vulva. The mammary gland houses the lactiferous duct that provides nutrition in the form of milk to infants after their birth. Primary female sex organs include a pair of ovaries, which are located one on each side of the lower abdomen. \n\nEach ovary is covered by an outer thin layer called the germinal epithelium. The germinal epithelium encloses the ovarian stroma, which is further divided into the outer cortex and the inner medulla. The cortex consists of many ovarian follicles in different stages of development.  The ovarian follicle is the basic unit of the female reproductive system. Each oviduct is differentiated into three parts, namely infundibulum, ampulla, and isthmus. \n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\n\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9fDiLOMB2lA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9fDiLOMB2lA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9fDiLOMB2lA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9fDiLOMB2lA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9fDiLOMB2lA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"LearnNext","playlistId":"PL9m8xUWwHESA1HiJEcfZzy18O7_UFw1WJ","position":10,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"9fDiLOMB2lA"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"LearnNext","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"9fDiLOMB2lA","videoPublishedAt":"2018-04-03T12:28:02Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"ADrgOfXukfa9uwx6sGzfvrWWD2U","id":"UEw5bTh4VVd3SEVTQTFIaUpFY2ZaenkxOE83X1VGdzFXSi5EMEEwRUY5M0RDRTU3NDJC","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-05T09:55:35Z","channelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw","title":"Class 12 | Biology | Evolution | Origin of Life","description":"Class 12 | Biology | Evolution | Origin of Life\n\nIn this module, you will learn about the origin of life. \n\nLooking at the pictures of these extinct prehistoric animals, it is difficult to believe that they had once walked on our planet. \n\nIn fact, the earth and its numerous life forms were originally different. To understand the changes in life forms on earth over millions of years, we need to know how life originated. \n\nThe origin of life forms or biodiversity is interlinked with the evolution of the earth, which is again closely associated with the evolution of the universe. \nThe universe is vast, comprises many galaxies and is almost twenty billion years old. \n\nThe Big Bang Theory attempts to explain the origin of the universe. According to this theory, a singular huge explosion caused the infinitesimally small, hot and dense universe to expand, which resulted in the lowering of temperatures. It even states that the universe continues to expand even today.\n\nAfter the passage of time, gases such as hydrogen and helium got formed. They condensed due to gravitation and gave rise to different galaxies in the universe. \n\nOne of the galaxies known to us is the Milky Way, which contains the solar system and the earth is one of the planets in this system. \n\nAt the time of its formation, there was no atmosphere on the earth. Its surface was covered by water vapor, methane, carbon dioxide and ammonia released from the molten mass. \n\nGradually, the ultraviolet rays of the sun broke up the water, which was in the vapor state, into hydrogen and oxygen. \n\nHydrogen is a lighter gas than oxygen, escaped. \n\nThereafter, oxygen combined with ammonia and methane, which led to the formation of water, carbon dioxide, and other gases. \n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mT__bWt1Eeg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mT__bWt1Eeg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mT__bWt1Eeg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mT__bWt1Eeg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mT__bWt1Eeg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"LearnNext","playlistId":"PL9m8xUWwHESA1HiJEcfZzy18O7_UFw1WJ","position":11,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"mT__bWt1Eeg"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"LearnNext","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"mT__bWt1Eeg","videoPublishedAt":"2018-04-03T12:32:15Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"C1zE2AhOj213GIo062zmgX6gGeg","id":"UEw5bTh4VVd3SEVTQTFIaUpFY2ZaenkxOE83X1VGdzFXSi45ODRDNTg0QjA4NkFBNkQy","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-05T09:56:13Z","channelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw","title":"Class 12 | Biology | Environmental Issues","description":"Class 12 | Biology | Environmental Issues | Domestic sewage and industrial effluents\n\nIn this module, you will learn about domestic sewage and industrial effluents that cause water pollution. \n\nDid you know that less than 1 percent of the fresh water on earth can be directly used for human consumption? \n\nRapid urbanisation and industrialisation have brought into focus the consequences of environmental pollution.\n\nThe problem is enhanced by the fact that most water bodies have become contaminated with a variety of pollutants. \n\nPollutants flowing into water bodies are broadly classified as domestic sewage and industrial effluents. \n\nThe term \u2018domestic sewage\u2019 refers to wastewater that drains from houses in a town or city. \n\nThis domestic sewage contains about 99.9 percent water and 0.1 percent impurities such as suspended soils, colloidal and dissolved materials. \n\nSadly, this small percentage of impurities makes water unfit for human consumption. \n\nEvery town or city has sewage treatment plants for the removal of these pollutants before they are released into rivers or the sea. \n\nThe removal of solids is relatively easy compared to dissolved salts such as nitrates and phosphates, and toxic metals such as lead and mercury, and organic compounds such as dyes and pesticides. \n\nApart from these pollutants, micro-organisms also form a primary component of the sewage. These micro-organisms decompose and treat the organic sewage matter by using it as a substrate to multiply. \n\nHowever, during this process of decomposition, micro-organisms require a lot of oxygen, which is measured in terms of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD).\n\nThe concentration of BOD in the sewage water discharged into the water is high. A high concentration of BOD automatically translates into low amounts of dissolved oxygen or DO as depicted in this graph.\n\nHigh BOD and low DO ultimately cause the death of fish and other aquatic creatures. \n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\n\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jMeV7sesdfs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jMeV7sesdfs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jMeV7sesdfs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jMeV7sesdfs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jMeV7sesdfs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"LearnNext","playlistId":"PL9m8xUWwHESA1HiJEcfZzy18O7_UFw1WJ","position":12,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"jMeV7sesdfs"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"LearnNext","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"jMeV7sesdfs","videoPublishedAt":"2018-04-03T12:37:23Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"_ZLPHMDCG-k7yJ1rjrCjjcR9OwY","id":"UEw5bTh4VVd3SEVTQTFIaUpFY2ZaenkxOE83X1VGdzFXSi4zMDg5MkQ5MEVDMEM1NTg2","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-05T09:57:11Z","channelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw","title":"Class 12 | Biology | Ecosystem | Decomposition in an Ecosystem","description":"Class 12 | Biology | Ecosystem | Decomposition in an Ecosystem\n\nIn this module, you will learn about decomposition in an ecosystem. \n\nDid you know that if decomposers did not exist, the earth would be covered by a layer of dead flies about twenty feet deep within a month? \n\nDecomposers play a very important role in keeping our environment clean. \n\nThey break down complex organic matter and convert it into simple inorganic substances like water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients. This natural process is known as decomposition.\n\nThe raw material for decomposition is the detritus, which comprises dead and decaying plant remains such as leaves, branches, flowers, roots and dead animal remains, including faecal matter. \n\nDecomposition involves a series of important steps, namely fragmentation, leaching, catabolism, humification, and mineralisation. \n\nOf these steps, fragmentation, leaching and catabolism occur simultaneously on the detritus. \n\nDuring fragmentation, the detritus is broken down into smaller particles by detritivores, which are organisms that feed on and break down dead plant or animal matter while returning essential nutrients to the environment. \n\nSome examples of detritivores include fungi, insects like dung flies and terrestrial worms such as earthworms and millipedes .\n\nDuring leaching, inorganic nutrients that are soluble in water drain into the soil and get precipitated as unavailable salts. While during catabolism, the detritus is further acted upon by bacteria and fungi and is degraded into simpler inorganic substances by the action of their enzymes. \n\nThe next step of decomposition is humification, where the detritus gets converted into a dark, amorphous substance called humus. \n\nTo watch the complete video.\nVisit: https://www.learnnext.com/CBSE/Class-12/Biology/Ecosystem/Decomposition-in-an-Ecosystem/L-1804897.htm#container","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/REU1n_esNeM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/REU1n_esNeM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/REU1n_esNeM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/REU1n_esNeM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/REU1n_esNeM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"LearnNext","playlistId":"PL9m8xUWwHESA1HiJEcfZzy18O7_UFw1WJ","position":13,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"REU1n_esNeM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"LearnNext","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"REU1n_esNeM","videoPublishedAt":"2018-04-04T05:57:30Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"BVKPzuyVHsYOa_2dFG1yf4nhmuQ","id":"UEw5bTh4VVd3SEVTQTFIaUpFY2ZaenkxOE83X1VGdzFXSi41Mzk2QTAxMTkzNDk4MDhF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-25T06:50:06Z","channelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw","title":"Testimonial : LearnNext User who secured 95% in XII CBSE final exams","description":"Congratulations to Mr. Pranav a user from LearnNext who secured 95% in his class  XII CBSE final exams.\n\nLearnNext is an interactive, computer-based self-learning solution which helps students retain concepts better and perfect them with exhaustive practice and tests.
