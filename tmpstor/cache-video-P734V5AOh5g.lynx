In this module, you will learn to compare like fractions.
Here are three candy boxes that are divided into six equal parts.
The first box has one-sixth candies, the second box has three-sixth candies in it and the third has five-sixth candies in it.
The denominators of all three fractions are the same.
Such fractions are called like fractions.
Fractions having the same denominator are called like fractions.
Of the three fractions, we can see that one-sixth is smaller than three-sixth and three-sixth is smaller that five-sixth.
Like fractions can be compared by comparing their numerators.
The fraction with a smaller numerator will have a smaller value compared to the fraction with a greater numerator.
Now letâ€™s consider another example. There are two, three by four boxes of red marbles,  and three, one by four boxes of green marbles.
