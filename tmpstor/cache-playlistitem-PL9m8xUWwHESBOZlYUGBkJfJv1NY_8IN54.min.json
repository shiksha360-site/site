Birds fly, horses gallop, water flows through rivers and cars move. You say these are in motion. Thus, the motion is a state of an object in which, there is a change in its position with respect to its surroundings.\nWhen a car race starts, the position of each car participating in the race changes relative to the stands, and spectators. This is because the cars are in a state of motion.\nWhat happens when we compare the state of two or more than two objects?\n\nFor instance, let us consider the state of a car driver:\nIs he at rest or in motion?\n\nIt is difficult to answer this question. This is because, with respect to the car, the driver is at rest but with respect to the other things around, he is in motion. \nThus, the states of rest and motion of bodies are relative. Absolute states of rest or motion do not exist.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\n\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gCcTpsKtWEU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gCcTpsKtWEU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gCcTpsKtWEU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gCcTpsKtWEU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"LearnNext","playlistId":"PL9m8xUWwHESBOZlYUGBkJfJv1NY_8IN54","position":23,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"gCcTpsKtWEU"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"LearnNext","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"gCcTpsKtWEU","videoPublishedAt":"2018-04-06T13:08:23Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"mys87uBCKhOLJEarZeSXAUYy7pQ","id":"UEw5bTh4VVd3SEVTQk9abFlVR0JrSmZKdjFOWV84SU41NC5DNzE1RjZEMUZCMjA0RDBB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-07T12:23:17Z","channelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw","title":"Class 9 | Science | Natural Resources | Biogeochemical Cycle","description":"Class 9 | Science | Natural Resources | Biogeochemical Cycle\n\nIn this module, you will learn about biogeochemical cycles \u2013 the water cycle and the nitrogen cycle.\nWhat is the biogeochemical cycle?\nThe cycling of chemicals between the biological and the geological world is called biogeochemical cycle.\nThe biotic and abiotic components of the biosphere constantly interact through these cycles.\nThese interactions enable the transfer of nutrients between living organisms and nonliving environment.\nWhat are the four most important biogeochemical cycles?\nThe four most important biogeochemical cycles are water cycle, nitrogen cycle, carbon cycle, and oxygen cycle.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\n\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sqly00vNDZU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sqly00vNDZU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sqly00vNDZU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sqly00vNDZU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"LearnNext","playlistId":"PL9m8xUWwHESBOZlYUGBkJfJv1NY_8IN54","position":24,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Sqly00vNDZU"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"LearnNext","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"Sqly00vNDZU","videoPublishedAt":"2018-04-07T12:23:15Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Cf2HDmk3RUBoNLAcnPdmN5CX-r8","id":"UEw5bTh4VVd3SEVTQk9abFlVR0JrSmZKdjFOWV84SU41NC43MTI1NDIwOTMwQjIxMzNG","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-07T12:28:26Z","channelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw","title":"Class 9 | Science | Structure of the Atom | Atomic Models","description":"Class 9 | Science | Structure of the Atom | Atomic Models\n\nIn this module, you will learn about Thomson\u2019s Atomic Model. \nAre the charged particles arranged in any particular manner? Are the charged particles spread throughout the atom or are they concentrated in one place? To answer these questions, let\u2019s go back in time\u2026\nDalton\u2019s atomic theory stated that an atom was indivisible and indestructible. However, in 1886, Goldstein came upon positively charged radiations in a gas discharge, which he termed as canal rays. These radiations led to the discovery of the proton. The mass of a proton was about 2000 times that of an electron and it carried a positive charge. \nAround the year 1900, J. J. Thomson conducted experiments on the beams of particles inside a glass tube called a cathode ray tube. He found that the particles were attracted to the positive terminal of the tube. Thomson concluded that the particles must be negatively charged and called these particles \u2018electrons\u2019. An electron has a negligible mass and has a charge of minus one.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\n\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3TcGYfcyl3A/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3TcGYfcyl3A/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3TcGYfcyl3A/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3TcGYfcyl3A/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"LearnNext","playlistId":"PL9m8xUWwHESBOZlYUGBkJfJv1NY_8IN54","position":25,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"3TcGYfcyl3A"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"LearnNext","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"3TcGYfcyl3A","videoPublishedAt":"2018-04-07T12:28:24Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"MS4ALWNTLZE3oCO2jhF9L14UGEY","id":"UEw5bTh4VVd3SEVTQk9abFlVR0JrSmZKdjFOWV84SU41NC5DQ0MyQ0Y4Mzg0M0VGOEYw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-07T12:33:11Z","channelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw","title":"Class 9 | Science | Tissue | Animal Tissues","description":"Class 9 | Science | Tissue | Animal Tissues\n\nIn this module, you will learn about different types of animal tissues. \nIt takes many cells to form tissues and many tissues to form organs.
