The existence of such a large number of organic compounds is due to the unique properties of carbon.\nThe unique properties of carbon are: \n\u2022 Tetravalency, \n\u2022 Catenation, and \n\u2022 Formation of multiple bonds.  \n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hPwM87f1QkA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hPwM87f1QkA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hPwM87f1QkA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hPwM87f1QkA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"LearnNext","playlistId":"PL9m8xUWwHESAjbzVU7GaC64xHQYvUlphH","position":23,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"hPwM87f1QkA"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"LearnNext","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"hPwM87f1QkA","videoPublishedAt":"2018-04-23T07:04:56Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"hsEgwPYFqjWEI9koY0Y3DEVu8is","id":"UEw5bTh4VVd3SEVTQWpielZVN0dhQzY0eEhRWXZVbHBoSC40QTA3NTU2RkM1QzlCMzYx","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-23T07:15:07Z","channelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw","title":"Class 10 | Science | Electricity | Current Electricity Circuits","description":"Class 10 | Science | Electricity | Current Electricity Circuits\n\nIn this module you will learn about electric current and potential difference.\nBefore learning about the cause and applications of electric current, let us examine the features of electric current.\n\nTypically, in a conductor, free electrons move randomly. When these electrons are influenced to move uniformly in a specific direction, we get electricity or electric current. The direction of electric current is opposite to the direction of flow of electrons.\nElectric current requires a continuous path of conductive material to provide a conduit for electrons to travel through.\n\nElectrons move in the empty spaces within and between the atoms of a conductor.\nYou can measure electric current as the rate of flow of charge or the amount of charge flowing through a point per unit time. Electric current is measured using an ammeter.\nThe unit for current is ampere. Ampere is often shortened to amp and is denoted by the unit symbol A. One ampere is equal to one coulomb of electric charge per second.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eKio65g1Txo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eKio65g1Txo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eKio65g1Txo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eKio65g1Txo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"LearnNext","playlistId":"PL9m8xUWwHESAjbzVU7GaC64xHQYvUlphH","position":24,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"eKio65g1Txo"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"LearnNext","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"eKio65g1Txo","videoPublishedAt":"2018-04-23T07:15:06Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"GN-OlUfRX6XQrWlXw6vDG41bc_s","id":"UEw5bTh4VVd3SEVTQWpielZVN0dhQzY0eEhRWXZVbHBoSC41MzY4MzcwOUFFRUU3QzEx","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-22T10:05:14Z","channelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw","title":"CBSE Class 10 | Civics  | Outcomes of Democracy | Political Outcome |","description":"In this module, you will learn about Political Outcome.The expected political outcome of democracy is an accountable, responsive and legitimate government.

The government can take steps to make sure that the benefits of globalization reach everybody by Formulating watertight labor laws in favor of the workers. Having policies that protect the interests of the small producers against the MNCs. Erecting barriers against trade and investment within the country, and against unfair competition from developed countries. Apart from the government, people from various professions also need to come out and raise their voice against unfair globalization.

Let\u2019s look at some reasons why we prefer democracy over dictatorship. Democracy promotes equality among citizens and enhances the dignity of the individual. It improves the quality of decision-making, provides a method to resolve conflicts, and allows room for correction. Democracy is seen to be good in principle, but not in practice. We know that democratic countries the world over follow democracy differently, depending on their social situations, economic achievements, and cultures. However, there are certain basic outcomes we expect out of every democracy. As a political outcome of democracy, we expect an accountable, responsive and legitimate government. As an economic outcome, we expect that democracies produce economic growth and development, and reduce poverty and inequality. As a social outcome, we expect democracy to accommodate the social diversity in a society, and provide dignity and freedom to all citizens. When such expectations are not met, we start blaming democracy. What we need to understand is that democracy is just a form of government; it can only create suitable conditions for us. As citizens, we have to take advantage of those conditions and achieve our goals. You have now reached the end of this module on assessing the outcomes of democracy. In this module, you learned that: Democracy is preferred over dictatorship because it: Promotes equality among citizens Enhances the dignity of the individual Improves the quality of decision-making Provides a method to resolve conflicts Allows room to correct mistakes Democracy is a form of government that only creates conditions for better living. As citizens, it is our responsibility to take advantage of those conditions.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd\n\nLearnNext is an interactive, computer-based self-learning solution which helps students retain concepts better and perfect them with exhaustive practice and tests.

This can be either directly or indirectly. The pressure groups are either formed or led by the leader of political parties or act as the extended form of political parties. In most cases, the relationship between parties and interest groups or movement groups is not direct. They often take positions that are opposed to each other, yet they are in dialogue and negotiation.

Mass scale protest by the people started in the country and a new alliance of labour, human rights and community leaders was formed in January 2000. The struggle in Nepal was about the foundation of the country\u2019s politics whereas the movement in Bolivia was about one specific policy. In a democratic country, the conflicts are usually resolved by existing institutions like the parliament or the judiciary.

Similarly, in a democracy, the disadvantaged and discriminated castes can also claim their right to equal status and equal opportunity. Although caste-based inequalities and atrocities continue to exist even today, they lack moral and legal foundations. People will always have expectations and complaints about the way democracy functions. This by itself is an indication that people have developed awareness, and expect those in power to be accountable to citizens. Most people today realize that their vote matters - it gives them a say in the running of the government and ensures that their interests are protected.

Use of renewable resources faster than what nature can restore can lead to their scarcity.

The tertiary sector has become the largest contributor to India\u2019s GDP. The increase in production in manufacturing and services is not matched by an increase in employment opportunities in these sectors. The primary sector is the largest employer providing work to more than 50 percent of the working population. More people engaged in agriculture than required leads to underemployment or disguised unemployment. The surplus workers could be employed more gainfully elsewhere. Many workers in the manufacturing and services sectors suffer from underemployment. More employment opportunities can be generated by:\nImproving rural infrastructure\nProviding easy, affordable loans to farmers\nPromoting rural industries\nExpanding education and healthcare services\nPromoting tourism \nProperly implementing employment generation schemes like NREGA\nThe National Rural Employment Guarantee Act was implemented by the Central government in 2005. NREGA guarantees 100 days of employment per year to every person willing to work, and an unemployment allowance if work is not provided.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd\n\nLearnNext is an interactive, computer-based self-learning solution which helps students retain concepts better and perfect them with exhaustive practice and tests.

The primary, secondary and tertiary sectors of the economy involve the production of a large number of goods and services. Every product or service has a value. The final values of goods are used to calculate the production in a sector. The sum of the total production in the three sectors in a year for a country gives the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for that country in that year. GDP is a globally accepted indicator of the size and health of a country\u2019s economy. The contribution of different sectors to the GDP of a country depends on the state of development of that country\u2019s economy. At the initial stage of development, the primary sector is the biggest contributor to GDP. In a developing economy, the secondary sector becomes the biggest contributor to GDP. In developed countries, the tertiary sector is the biggest contributor to GDP. The tertiary sector has become the largest sector of India\u2019s economy. The tertiary sector has expanded due to:  The government\u2019s initiatives for the expansion of essential services  The development of agriculture and industry support services The growing demand for better and leisure services The development and expansion of communication and information services.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd\n\nLearnNext is an interactive, computer-based self-learning solution which helps students retain concepts better and perfect them with exhaustive practice and tests.

Poor households in India largely depend on the informal sector for credit. Banks demand collateral against a loan that poor people cannot provide. The members of a self-help group save regularly to create a savings pool. Members of the group can take small loans from their combined savings. The loans bear interest at low rates. After saving regularly for a few years, a self-help group becomes eligible for a bank loan without collateral. The loan is used to generate more income and employment opportunities. The members of a self-help group make all the decisions jointly and are jointly responsible for the repayment of loans. Banks also extend loans to poor women organised in self-help groups. Self-help groups allow poor people access to affordable, easy credit.\nThe Grameen Bank of Bangladesh is a brilliant example of meeting credit needs of the poor at affordable rates.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd\n\nLearnNext is an interactive, computer-based self-learning solution which helps students retain concepts better and perfect them with exhaustive practice and tests.

This saturates the soil for cultivation.\nOne of the most widely used methods of collecting rain water is rooftop rainwater harvesting.\nIn a rooftop rainwater harvesting system, rain water falling on the roof is collected and then filtered before being stored in tanks for immediate use. Excess water is diverted to wells to recharge groundwater.\nIn many parts of Rajasthan, rain water collected through rooftop harvesting is collected in large underground reservoirs, called tankas.\nAlmost all households in Shillong in Meghalaya use rooftop rainwater harvesting to meet almost 20 percent of their total requirement of water.\nEach of the 200 households in Gendathur, Karnataka, that adopted rooftop rainwater harvesting can collect 50,000 litres of rain water every year for its use.\nIn bamboo drip irrigation, shallow channels are made from split bamboos, which are used to divert water from rain-fed springs to the farmers. Channel sections are used in the farm to water the plants. \n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd\n\nLearnNext is an interactive, computer-based self-learning solution which helps students retain concepts better and perfect them with exhaustive practice and tests.

What is water scarcity. The unavailability of sufficient clean water to meet personal, domestic and industrial requirements in an area is called water scarcity. We usually associate the problem of water scarcity with dry, hot regions like desserts that receives scanty rainfall and have very few celsus of clean surface water. Here is a map that shows projected water scarcity in the world by the year two thousand twenty five As you can see water scarcity is said to become a serious problem in the whole of India. Not all regions that face water scarcity have poor water resources. What leads to water scarcity in regions that have abundant water resources. An increase in demand, unequal access to water, overexploitation and contamination of existing water resources are the main factors that lead to water scarcity in regions with abundant water resources. Let us study these factors in detail. This brings us to the question what are the main causes of water scarcity? India has a second highest population in the world which is still increasing fast. An increase in population means a greater demand for fresh water for personal and domestic use. To feed the increasing population more and more land is brought under cultivation. \nThis also increases the demand for water for irrigation purposes. Six independence India has seen a major industrial revolution, rapid industrialisation exerts greater demand on water resources. Since industries use a huge quantity of water for production and cleaning. Over seventy percent of India's population still lives in villages. However people living in cities have better access to water than people living in most villages. This unequal access to water resources also leads to water scarcity. Groundwater is an important freshwater resource. However in order to increase their produce most farmers today use private tube-wells to irrigate their fields. This over exploitation of underground water is leading to falling water table and water scarcity. Similarly the use of bore-wells by modern housing societies to provide water to their residents is also over-exploitation of underground water resources. Fresh water resources like rivers and lakes are often treated as dumping round for domestic use and industrial waste. This pollutes the fresh water and makes it unfit for our use. Such contamination of fresh water also contributes to water scarcity.

Primitive subsistence farming:\nInvolves cultivating food crops in small fields essentially to sustain the farmer\u2019s family. Depends entirely on local soil and environment conditions and monsoons. Involves hard manual labour. Is slash-and-burn agriculture. Allows the soil to regain its fertility naturally.\nGives very poor yield and leads to a large-scale destruction of forests Besides India, slash-and-burn or shifting cultivation is practiced in many parts of the world and known by different names. In India, the most popular name for such shifting cultivation is Jhumming, by which it is known in many of our north-eastern states. Intensive subsistence farming:: Is practised in densely populated areas of India\nAims to get maximum yield from the available land through extensive irrigation and use of large quantities of chemical fertilisers. Repeated division of land amongst successive generations of farmers decreases individual land holding, further encouraging farmers to use all available means to increase yield. Commercial farming: Involves the cultivation of a crop in large quantities for the purpose of selling it in the market Uses high yielding seeds, chemical fertilisers and pesticides Plantations are also forms of commercial farming.

the textile industry.\nCotton, woollen and silk are the main types of textiles produced in India.\nIndia\u2019s textile industry is completely self-reliant in terms of raw material and technology to produce finished garments from raw fibre.\nAt present, there are around 16,000 cotton textile mills in India.\nThe cotton textile industry supports people in a number of jobs, like farmers, cotton pickers, and workers engaged in ginning, spinning, weaving, dyeing, designing, packaging and tailoring.\nIn its modern form, the cotton textile industry started developing in India in the cotton growing regions of Maharashtra and Gujarat.\nThe cotton yarn spinning industry is still concentrated in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, while the weaving industry is spread over several parts of India.\nIndia holds 25 percent share in the world market of cotton yarn, but only 4 percent in cotton garments.\nMost industries in the weaving sector produce poor quality fabric for local markets.\nIndia exports high-quality cotton yarn, but imports good quality cotton fabric.\nThe main challenges faced by the cotton textile industry in India are:\nNeed to import raw cotton to use the spinning capacity.\nUnreliable supply of power.\nLow output of labour.\nNeed to upgrade machinery.\nCompetition from the synthetic fibre industry.\nIndia is the world\u2019s largest producer of raw jute. \nIndia is the second largest exporter or raw jute and jute products in the world after Bangladesh. \nIndia has around 70 jute mills, most of which are located in West Bengal along the Hugli

Class 10 | Geography | Industrial Pollution & Environmental Degradation |","description":"In this module, you will learn about Industrial Pollution & Environmental Degradation, Industrialisation has caused severe pollution of our natural resources.\nIndustries cause environmental degradation through:\nAir pollution\nWater pollution\nLand pollution or soil degradation\nNoise pollution\nSmoke contains undesirable gases like carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide, besides solid and liquid particulate matter in the form of dust and spray mist that cause air pollution.\nAir pollution affects the health of humans, animals and plants alike, and also causes damage to buildings.\nWater pollution is caused by the discharge of untreated chemical waste, heavy metals like lead and mercury, pesticides, fertilisers and plastics from industries, into fresh water bodies like rivers and lakes.\nSolid wastes like fly ash, phospo-gypsum, iron and steel slag also cause water pollution.\nThe industries that cause major amount of water pollution are paper and pulp industries, oil refineries, tanneries, and electroplating industries.\nThe discharge of hot water from thermal power plants into rivers before cooling is called thermal pollution of water.\nRadioactive waste, hazardous chemicals, glass, plastic, industrial effluents and non-biodegradable garbage are the main agents of land pollution.\nRain water falling on polluted land dissolves and carries many pollutants further into the ground and pollutes groundwater.\nIndustrial machinery, construction activities, generators, and equipment like saws and pneumatic drills, are mainly responsible for noise pollution. \nLoud noise can lead to irritation, loss of hearing, and an increase in the blood pressure and heart rate.\nPolluted wastewater from industries must be treated before releasing it into water bodies.\nWastewater treatment involves:\nPrimary treatment through screening, grinding, flocculation and sedimentation\nSecondary treatment through bacterial action to digest harmful chemicals\nTertiary stage of stirring with chemicals to neutralise remaining harmful waste\nTreated wastewater can be recycled for reuse in industrial processes.\nRainwater harvesting can be used to meet the requirements of water for industrial processes.\nLegal provisions must be made to regulate the use of groundwater for industrial use.\nSmoke stacks, filters, scrubbers, and electrostatic and inertial separators remove a large amount of harmful particles from industrial smoke.\nThe emission of smoke from industries can be reduced by using more efficient fuels like oil and natural gas in place of coal.\nIndustrial and generator silencers, and sound-absorbing material should be used to reduce the

Congress was hesitant to support the No \u2013rent campaign of tenants for the fear of alienating the rich peasants. The industrial working class adopted a few Gandhian ideas selectively to support their movements against low wages and poor working condition. The failure of the Second Round table Conference and the growth of socialist ideas in Congress disappointed the business class who had supported the movement. The rich peasant communities such as Patidars of Gujarat and Jats of UP were badly affected by the Economic Depression and the resultant fall in agricultural prices. They demanded the revenue to be waived off but the government refused. Therefore, they joined the Civil Disobedience Movement.\nIn 1931, the Civil Disobedience Movement was abruptly called off by Mahatma Gandhi\n   without any revision of the revenue rates. Consequently, the peasants did not participate in \n   the Civil Disobedience Movement when it was re launched in 1932.\nThe poor peasants grappled with the problem of paying rent during the time of Depression.\nThe Congress was uncertain about supporting the poor peasants in their \u2018No Rent\u2019 campaign.\n    The Congress feared that supporting the tenants could spoil their ties with the Landlords and \n    rich peasants.\nIndian business class had reaped huge profits during the First World War. After the war, they \n    wanted to expand their business but the stringent colonial laws were obstructing their way.\nTo get the business class together, Indian Industrial and Commercial Congress was formed in \n   1920 and the Federation of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FICCI) in 1927.\nBusiness class viewed Swaraj as an ideal situation, favourable for the growth of their business,\n   a time when all colonial restrictions would be removed.\nHowever, the failure of the Second Round table Conference and the growth of socialist ideas\n    in Congress disappointed the business class and made them anxious about the future.\nThe Industrial working class adopted a few Gandhian ideas such as boycott of Foreign goods as\n    part of their own movement against low wages and poor working condition.\nThe Congress still did not want to include workers\u2019 demands in the movement as they thought\n   it would alienate the industrialists.\nThe Civil Disobedience Movement witnessed mass participation of women. They were\n    involved in protests, picketing and boycotts and also helped in manufacturing salt.\nOn the face of it, Congress encouraged women participation but even Mahatma Gandhi gave\n    more importance to the traditional domestic role of women.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd\n\nLearnNext is an interactive, computer-based self-learning solution which helps students retain concepts better and perfect them with exhaustive practice and tests.

He also wrote\n    our national song \u2018Vande Mataram\u2019.\nAbanindra Nath Tagore created the famous image of Bharat Mata as an ascetic figure. She\n   wore saffron coloured clothes and carried chain of beads, cloth, palm leaves and scriptures in  \n   her hands. \nThe portrayal of Bharat Mata underwent a lot of changes. In the 1905, painting by \n   Abhanindranath tagore Bharat Mata is not portrayed as an ascetic. She is holding a flag and\n    standing beside an Elephant and Lion both of which are symbols of power and authority.\nRevival of the Indian Folklore was another process which contributed to the growth of \n    nationalism. In the late 19th century, the nationalists began gathering the folk tales.\nThe Indian tricoloured flag with red green and yellow colour was first designed during the \n    Swadeshi Movement in Bengal.\nIn 1921, Mahatma Gandhi redesigned the Indian flag with the spinning wheel or Charka at \n    the centre.\nThe growth of nationalism also happened through the process of reinterpretation of history. \nIndians began exploring glories from their past. They wrote about the ancient times when \n   India was much developed.They saw the Colonial British era an opposition to the Golden \n   years of the past.\nThe glories of the past and the national symbols such as Bharat Mata were all very Hindu in\n    nature.

Moreover, the prices paid to the weavers were also low.\nDue to the exploitation, some weavers rebelled, while some migrated to other villages. Some of them became agricultural labourers.\nWith the arrival of goods from Manchester, the weavers faced stiff competition in the local markets. Due to the import duties overseas, Indian weavers lost their overseas market as well.\nDuring the US Civil War, Britain turned to India for raw cotton, which led to an increase in cotton prices.\nTowards the end of the 19th century, India saw the growth of factories, and the fine art of weaving died a slow death.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd\n\nLearnNext is an interactive, computer-based self-learning solution which helps students retain concepts better and perfect them with exhaustive practice and tests.

People with diverse ethnic groups lived in eastern and central Europe.\nSome of the prominent empires in Europe at this time were the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburg Empire.\nPeople residing in the Habsburg Empire spoke different dialects and did not share a collective past. \nThe ethnic diversity in Europe provided a ready ground for the growth of nationalistic ideas inspired by the French Revolution.\nDuring the 19th century, the landed aristocracy was a small but influential class in Europe.\nMembers of the aristocracy in Europe were connected to each other because of their similar way of life and inter-marriages.\nAristocrats owned large estates in the country side and town houses.\nFrench was a common language spoken by the aristocracy for diplomacy and high society.\nA majority of the European population was made up of peasants.\nIn the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, new social groups came into existence. They were:\nWorking class\nMiddle class\nThe middle class was characterised by its free-thinking liberal mindset.\nThe middle class wanted the end of autocratic rule and form a people\u2019s government.\nThe word liberalism traces its roots from the Latin word \u2018liber,\u2019 meaning freedom. The concept of liberalism was born in the middle class.\nThe middle class believed in the need for freedom and equality of all individuals before law.\nAlthough liberalism popularised the idea of a people\u2019s government, the right to vote or suffrage was not extended to all citizens.\nIn France, women were given the status of a minor and subjugated to the authority of men.\nThroughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, women and non-propertied men organised protests and movements demanding equal rights.\nLiberalism implied freedom of markets, and unrestricted movement of goods and capital.\nThe Napoleonic Code, though revolutionary for its time, was not able to address the growing needs of the industrialists.\nIn 1834, a customs union or \u2018Zollverein` was formed at the initiative of Prussia and joined by most of the German states.\nThis union eliminated tariff barriers and reduced the number of currencies from over 30 to 2.\nA railway network was also formed which enhanced mobility and communication.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd\n\nLearnNext is an interactive, computer-based self-learning solution which helps students retain concepts better and perfect them with exhaustive practice and tests.

Their rivalry caused many wars and culminated in the First World War.\nLater, in the nineteenth century, the countries colonised by the European powers began to overthrow their imperial domination.\nMany countries struggled for the formation of nation states and each country was inspired by a sense of collective national unity.\nEvery country developed its own specific nationalism; there was one thing in common - the idea of organising societies as nation states.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd\n\nLearnNext is an interactive, computer-based self-learning solution which helps students retain concepts better and perfect them with exhaustive practice and tests.

It was also known as the liberty cap. French people wore these caps a few days before the storming of the Bastille.\nDuring revolutions, artists represented nation as a person in order to put life into abstract concepts like a nation.\nThe way of expressing an abstract idea like freedom or liberty through a symbol that may be person or thing is known as allegory. An allegory has a literal and a symbolic meaning.\nIn the 19th century, French artists used the female allegory, Marianne, to represent France.\nMarianne symbolises reason, liberty and the ideals of the republic\nShe wore a red cap and a knotted ribbon or cockade, and carried the French tricolour.\nStatues of Marianne were erected in public squares to familiarize people with Marianne as the national symbol of unity.\nImages of Marianne were used on coins and stamps.\nIn Germany, the allegory for nation was again a female figure called Germania.\nShe wears a crown of oak leaves, a symbol of heroism in Germany.\nGermania wears a breastplate with an eagle, which is a symbol of German strength.\nThe black, red and gold tricolour in Germania\u2019s hand is the flag of the liberal nationalists of 1848.\nThe sword in Germania\u2019s hand is a symbol of her readiness to fight.\nA flag is the symbol of unity and encourages people to be united.\nThe personification of a nation infused feelings of patriotism and nationalism in people.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd\n\nLearnNext is an interactive, computer-based self-learning solution which helps students retain concepts better and perfect them with exhaustive practice and tests.

The later women suffrages movements made people aware of the rights of women to vote and own property.\nFamilies became smaller and people had more time for leisure. \nRich people visited pleasure gardens equipped with sports facilities, entertainment and refreshments. \nThe State sponsored libraries, art galleries and museums, for the working classes, to educate, to entertain and to instil a sense of pride in people.\nCinema became the new form of mass entertainment.\nGroups of people could be drawn into political causes. For instance, the riots of 1886, the Bloody Sunday riots and the 12-day dockyard union\u2019s strike. \nState authorities tried to keep rebellion in check by enhancing the beauty of urban areas. \nHaussmanisation refers to the forcible reconstruction of cities to enhance their beauty and impose order. It displaced approximately 350,000 people from the centre of Paris.\nInitially criticised as boring, Haussman\u2019s redesigning of Paris was later appreciated by people all over the world. \n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd\n\nLearnNext is an interactive, computer-based self-learning solution which helps students retain concepts better and perfect them with exhaustive practice and tests.
