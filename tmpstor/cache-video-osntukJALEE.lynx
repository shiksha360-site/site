In this module, you will learn how to draw oblique and isometric sketches of solid shapes on a flat surface.
Two-dimensional figures can be drawn in such a way that they resemble three-dimensional shapes. 
For example, here is a solid cuboid. We can draw a figure resembling this cuboid on a flat surface like a paper.  
When completed, the two-dimensional figure resembles a solid shaped cuboid. 
These figures may be drawn either as an oblique sketch or an isometric sketch. 
For the oblique sketch, we will need a paper with squares printed on it. 
First we draw two rectangles as shown. 
Each rectangle has four vertices. We will join each vertex of one rectangle with the corresponding vertex of the other rectangle.
Now, the completed sketch looks like a cuboid.
