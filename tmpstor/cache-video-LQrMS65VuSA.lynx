Agriculture is the most important use of soil.
Agriculture provides all of us with food to eat, fibre for our clothes and material for making houses. Without soil, agriculture is not possible. Therefore, soil is a natural resource that is essential for life.
Soil has several other uses. Itâ€™s used in gardens, as well as in construction and pottery. 
 Soil is formed when rocks are broken down by the action of wind, water and climate. This process is called weathering. 

That is why the characteristic features of any soil depend upon the rocks from which it has been formed and the kind of plants that grow in it.
