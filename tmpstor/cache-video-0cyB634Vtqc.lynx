In this module, you will learn how to convert decimal numbers into a percentages and vice-versa.

Letâ€™s start with converting the number point zero seven to a percentage.
To convert from decimal to percentage, we just need to multiply the decimal by hundred percent. 
Here, we will multiply zero point zero seven with hundred percent to get seven percent.
The easiest way convert a decimal number into percentage is to move the decimal point two places to the right and add a percent sign.
So in point six five, we move the decimal point two places to the right.
We get sixty-five point zero which is equal to sixty-five.
Adding the percentage sign gives us sixty-five percent.
Narrator: Similarly, take a look at decimal number one point five.
Here we only have one place after the decimal point.
We know that many zeros can be placed after point five without changing its value. So how do we move the decimal point by two places?
We simply move the decimal point two places to the right by placing a decimal point after one zero to get one hundred and fifty points zero which is equal to one hundred and fifty and place a percent sign at the end.
Narrator: Another way of converting a decimal number zero point four to percentage is by converting the decimal to a fraction then multiplying it by hundred percent.
We get forty percent.
