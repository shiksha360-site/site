It thus becomes easier for women to struggle against what is legally and morally unacceptable. Similarly, in a democracy, the disadvantaged and discriminated castes can also claim their right to equal status and equal opportunity. Although caste-based inequalities and atrocities continue to exist even today, they lack moral and legal foundations. People will always have expectations and complaints about the way democracy functions. This by itself is an indication that people have developed awareness, and expect those in power to be accountable to citizens. Most people today realize that their vote matters - it gives them a say in the running of the government and ensures that their interests are protected. All in all, we can say that democracy has been largely successful in transforming people from mere bystanders into responsible citizens. You have now reached the end of this module on the social outcomes of democracy.\nDemocracy has been successful in transforming people into responsible citizens.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd\n\nLearnNext is an interactive, computer-based self-learning solution which helps students retain concepts better and perfect them with exhaustive practice and tests.

Let\u2019s look at some reasons why we prefer democracy over dictatorship. Democracy promotes equality among citizens and enhances the dignity of the individual. It improves the quality of decision-making, provides a method to resolve conflicts, and allows room for correction. Democracy is seen to be good in principle, but not in practice. We know that democratic countries the world over follow democracy differently, depending on their social situations, economic achievements, and cultures. However, there are certain basic outcomes we expect out of every democracy. As a political outcome of democracy, we expect an accountable, responsive and legitimate government. As an economic outcome, we expect that democracies produce economic growth and development, and reduce poverty and inequality. As a social outcome, we expect democracy to accommodate the social diversity in a society, and provide dignity and freedom to all citizens. When such expectations are not met, we start blaming democracy. What we need to understand is that democracy is just a form of government; it can only create suitable conditions for us. As citizens, we have to take advantage of those conditions and achieve our goals. You have now reached the end of this module on assessing the outcomes of democracy. In this module, you learned that: Democracy is preferred over dictatorship because it: Promotes equality among citizens Enhances the dignity of the individual Improves the quality of decision-making Provides a method to resolve conflicts Allows room to correct mistakes Democracy is a form of government that only creates conditions for better living.
