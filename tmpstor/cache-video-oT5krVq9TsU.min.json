One is a positive terminal and the other one is a negative terminal.  A chemical that helps produce electricity to connected devices.\n\nBulb\nA bulb consists two terminals.  A filament is a spirally wound wire inside the bulb supported by two thick wires at its ends. An electrical cell is connected to the terminals of a bulb so that electricity from the cell can pass through the bulb. This electricity makes the filament in the blub glow and emit light.
