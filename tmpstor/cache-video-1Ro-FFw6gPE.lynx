In this module, you will learn about the methods of separation of substances under wet conditions.
Sedimentation and Decantation 
Even liquids that do not mix with each other can be separated by the processes of sedimentation and decantation.
For example, water and oil.
Water is heavier than oil, so it settles at the bottom if you leave it alone for some time.
Once the water settles at the bottom, the oil can be seen floating on top.
Then, the oil can simply be poured out of the beaker.

Filtration 
Now, letâ€™s see how dirty water can be cleaned.
Dirty water can be completely cleaned using a filter paper.
This process of using a filter to separate substances is called filtration.
This will work as long as the holes or pores of the filter are small enough to keep the larger substances and let the smaller substances pass through.
