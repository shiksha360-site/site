One pan has four kilograms weight in it and the other has two kilograms.\n\nTo balance the scale, two kilograms are added to the left pan and four kilograms are added to the right pan.\nNow, the scale is balanced. This means that the sum of four and two kilograms is equal to the sum of two and four kilograms, which is equal to six kilograms. \n\nIn this module, you will learn to frame rules from arithmetic.\n\nLet\u2019s look at another example. The right pan has five kilograms and the left pan has three kilograms.\nTo balance the scale, three kilograms are added to the right pan and five kilograms to the left pan. \nThis means that the sum of three and five kilograms is equal to the sum of five and three kilograms, which is equal to eight kilograms. \nThis property of numbers is called commutativity of addition.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\n\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/la8uFV9Wl3U/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/la8uFV9Wl3U/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/la8uFV9Wl3U/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/la8uFV9Wl3U/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"LearnNext","tags":["class 6","class 6 maths","maths videos","class 6 videos","cbse maths","cbse class 6","Algebra","use of variable"],"categoryId":"27","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"Class 6 | Maths | Algebra Use Of Variable | Use of Variable","description":"Class 6 | Maths | Algebra Use Of Variable | Use of Variable\n\nConsider a weighing scale.
