This is called the excretory system.\nIn humans, this system consists of a pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters, a urinary bladder and urethra.\nThe kidneys are the main excretory organs of the body. They excrete water, salts, and urea in the form of urine.\nThey help maintain salt, water and body fluid balance, called homeostasis.\nIf the kidney is not functioning properly, the blood is purified externally by a process called dialysis.\nThe excretory system in plants greatly differs from that of animals. The technique used differs from plant to plant.\nPlants eject gaseous waste during respiration and photosynthesis. They eject water through transpiration and eject other wastes either through dead leaves or\ntissues such as cork, gum and resin.\n\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd\n\nLearnNext is an interactive, computer-based self-learning solution which helps students retain concepts better and perfect them with exhaustive practice and tests.

However, only a small fraction of the total available water on earth is usable for human requirements.\nThe negative impact of human activities such as deforestation and pollution is further reducing the amount of available water.\nSince water is so scarce and so valuable, it is very important to develop sustainable and environment friendly ways to manage water\nresources.\nDams are a popular method of managing resources. They provide benefits like availability of hydroelectric power and water to large areas.\nHowever, they also lead to several social, economic, and environmental problems.\nThere are several local methods of water resource management that are economic and environment friendly. It is important to recognize the\nvalue of these methods.\nCoal and petroleum are two other important natural resources. These are non renewable sources of energy.
