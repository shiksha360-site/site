The food we take in is converted into glucose by the digestive system.\nThe cells of living organisms require a constant supply of oxygen to release energy. This is done by a process called breathing.  Breathing involves two steps - one inhalation and one exhalation. The breath rate of human beings is 15 -- 18 breaths a minute.\nAir passes through the tiny hair in the nasal cavity, and then through the pharynx, larynx and windpipe before reaching the lungs.  The hairs in the nasal cavity prevent the entry of dust particles and pollen. The mucous lining is present from the nasal cavity to the lungs.

This property is named the heating effect of electric current.\nWhen electric current flows through a wire wound around an iron bar, the bar behaves like a magnet. This magnet is called an electromagnet.\nAn electromagnet is formed due to the magnetic effect of electric current. This magnetic effect of electric current was discovered by Hans Christian Oersted. Once, while preparing for a lecture, he noticed that there was a deflection in the needle of a magnetic compass kept near a wire that was connected to a battery. This deflection occurred every time the battery was switched on and off. He realised that a magnetic field is created around a current-carrying wire in a circuit.

For transporting goods, people used animals like donkeys, horses, mules, elephants, oxen, sled dogs, and even bison. Boats were also used as a means of transportation on water. The earliest boats were simple logs of wood with a hollow cavity.\n\nThe oldest wheel was discovered in Mesopotamia, and is believed to be over 5,500 years old. Fixed wheels for carts were invented around 3500 BC, according to some historians. After the invention of the wheel, man started using animals to pull vehicles that moved on wheels, and thus, bullock carts and chariots came into existence. Till the 19th century, most forms of transport used only animals.

Let\u2019s try and prove this property with the help of the number line.\nFirst, we represent the sum on the number line.\nNow we represent the second sum on the number line to check the final result. \nAs you can see, the result in both the cases is the same - that is minus nine.\nThe example shows us that we can either add \"minus three and minus two\" together and then add that sum to minus four to get the final answer, \nor we can add \"minus four and minus three\" together first and then add that sum to minus two to get the final answer. \nThe answer will be the same, no matter which way we do it.\nThis shows that addition is associative for integers.\nHence, \nfor any integers a, b and c, we have\na + (b + c) = (a + b) + c.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\n\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O7iyzhsdLXc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O7iyzhsdLXc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O7iyzhsdLXc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O7iyzhsdLXc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"LearnNext","playlistId":"PL9m8xUWwHESCpYLFJJyAwrwFkgPPPwieR","position":24,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"O7iyzhsdLXc"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"LearnNext","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"O7iyzhsdLXc","videoPublishedAt":"2018-04-12T12:06:23Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"1NLsjL5g-jrrCRGqRGuHk5vEh_A","id":"UEw5bTh4VVd3SEVTQ3BZTEZKSnlBd3J3RmtnUFBQd2llUi43MTI1NDIwOTMwQjIxMzNG","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-12T12:19:22Z","channelId":"UCB6ztajkwjXivfuI3M5tpEw","title":"Class 7 | Maths | Visualizing Solid Shapes | Viewing Different Sections of Solids","description":"Class 7 | Maths | Visualizing Solid Shapes | Viewing Different Sections of Solids\n\nIn this module, you will learn how to draw oblique and isometric sketches of solid shapes on a flat surface.\nTwo-dimensional figures can be drawn in such a way that they resemble three-dimensional shapes. \nFor example, here is a solid cuboid. We can draw a figure resembling this cuboid on a flat surface like a paper.  \nWhen completed, the two-dimensional figure resembles a solid shaped cuboid. \nThese figures may be drawn either as an oblique sketch or an isometric sketch. \nFor the oblique sketch, we will need a paper with squares printed on it. \nFirst we draw two rectangles as shown. \nEach rectangle has four vertices.
