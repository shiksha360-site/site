Wheat, for instance, is rich in carbohydrates but lacks nutrients like proteins and fats.
So, if we just eat wheat products, our body will not get all the nutrients required for healthy growth.
If this continues for a long time, we may suffer from a deficiency of nutrients like proteins and fats.

Thus, deficiency of one or more nutrients for a long period may lead to disorders or diseases called deficiency diseases.
What impact do deficiency diseases have on children?
Children
