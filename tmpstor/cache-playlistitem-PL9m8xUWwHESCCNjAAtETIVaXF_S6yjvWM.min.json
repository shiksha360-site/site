Congress was hesitant to support the No \u2013rent campaign of tenants for the fear of alienating the rich peasants. The industrial working class adopted a few Gandhian ideas selectively to support their movements against low wages and poor working condition. The failure of the Second Round table Conference and the growth of socialist ideas in Congress disappointed the business class who had supported the movement. The rich peasant communities such as Patidars of Gujarat and Jats of UP were badly affected by the Economic Depression and the resultant fall in agricultural prices. They demanded the revenue to be waived off but the government refused. Therefore, they joined the Civil Disobedience Movement.\nIn 1931, the Civil Disobedience Movement was abruptly called off by Mahatma Gandhi\n   without any revision of the revenue rates. Consequently, the peasants did not participate in \n   the Civil Disobedience Movement when it was re launched in 1932.\nThe poor peasants grappled with the problem of paying rent during the time of Depression.\nThe Congress was uncertain about supporting the poor peasants in their \u2018No Rent\u2019 campaign.\n    The Congress feared that supporting the tenants could spoil their ties with the Landlords and \n    rich peasants.\nIndian business class had reaped huge profits during the First World War. After the war, they \n    wanted to expand their business but the stringent colonial laws were obstructing their way.\nTo get the business class together, Indian Industrial and Commercial Congress was formed in \n   1920 and the Federation of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FICCI) in 1927.\nBusiness class viewed Swaraj as an ideal situation, favourable for the growth of their business,\n   a time when all colonial restrictions would be removed.\nHowever, the failure of the Second Round table Conference and the growth of socialist ideas\n    in Congress disappointed the business class and made them anxious about the future.\nThe Industrial working class adopted a few Gandhian ideas such as boycott of Foreign goods as\n    part of their own movement against low wages and poor working condition.\nThe Congress still did not want to include workers\u2019 demands in the movement as they thought\n   it would alienate the industrialists.\nThe Civil Disobedience Movement witnessed mass participation of women. They were\n    involved in protests, picketing and boycotts and also helped in manufacturing salt.\nOn the face of it, Congress encouraged women participation but even Mahatma Gandhi gave\n    more importance to the traditional domestic role of women.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd\n\nLearnNext is an interactive, computer-based self-learning solution which helps students retain concepts better and perfect them with exhaustive practice and tests.

He also wrote\n    our national song \u2018Vande Mataram\u2019.\nAbanindra Nath Tagore created the famous image of Bharat Mata as an ascetic figure. She\n   wore saffron coloured clothes and carried chain of beads, cloth, palm leaves and scriptures in  \n   her hands. \nThe portrayal of Bharat Mata underwent a lot of changes. In the 1905, painting by \n   Abhanindranath tagore Bharat Mata is not portrayed as an ascetic. She is holding a flag and\n    standing beside an Elephant and Lion both of which are symbols of power and authority.\nRevival of the Indian Folklore was another process which contributed to the growth of \n    nationalism. In the late 19th century, the nationalists began gathering the folk tales.\nThe Indian tricoloured flag with red green and yellow colour was first designed during the \n    Swadeshi Movement in Bengal.\nIn 1921, Mahatma Gandhi redesigned the Indian flag with the spinning wheel or Charka at \n    the centre.\nThe growth of nationalism also happened through the process of reinterpretation of history. \nIndians began exploring glories from their past. They wrote about the ancient times when \n   India was much developed.They saw the Colonial British era an opposition to the Golden \n   years of the past.\nThe glories of the past and the national symbols such as Bharat Mata were all very Hindu in\n    nature.

They persuaded peasants and artisans to produce for an international market.\nThe proto industrial times involved a lot of workers who were working from the countryside and not factories.\nBy the 1730s, factories began developing in Britain, but they actually expanded in the late 18th century.\nThe invention of the cloth mill by Richard Arkwright brought a revolution in cloth production by bringing together the scattered processes under one single roof.\nThe railway network expanded in Britain as well as in the colonies, and there was a huge demand for iron and steel.\nEven at the end of the 19th century, most textile production happened through domestic units.\nIndustrialists were still hesitant about the new machines due to their high repair and maintenance cost, so the shift to machines was a gradual and slow process.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd\n\nLearnNext is an interactive, computer-based self-learning solution which helps students retain concepts better and perfect them with exhaustive practice and tests.

Textiles were one of the most vital industries of India.\nThe old sea ports of Surat, Masulipatam and Hooghly also enhanced the textile trade, and connected India with the Gulf, ports of the Red Sea and that of South-East Asia.\nIndian merchants and bankers played a key role in this network of export trade. \nEuropean companies obtained several concessions from local courts and secured monopoly rights to trade.\nOld Indian ports shrank, and Bombay and Calcutta emerged as the new ports catering to European companies.\nAfter establishing its power, the East India Company developed a system of management and control to eradicate competition, control costs and ensure regular supply of textile goods.\nThe East India Company also appointed a paid servant, called the Gomastha, who supervised the weavers, collected their produce and examined the quality of cloth.\nThe Gomasthas were insensitive to the weavers. Moreover, the prices paid to the weavers were also low.\nDue to the exploitation, some weavers rebelled, while some migrated to other villages. Some of them became agricultural labourers.\nWith the arrival of goods from Manchester, the weavers faced stiff competition in the local markets.

People with diverse ethnic groups lived in eastern and central Europe.\nSome of the prominent empires in Europe at this time were the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburg Empire.\nPeople residing in the Habsburg Empire spoke different dialects and did not share a collective past. \nThe ethnic diversity in Europe provided a ready ground for the growth of nationalistic ideas inspired by the French Revolution.\nDuring the 19th century, the landed aristocracy was a small but influential class in Europe.\nMembers of the aristocracy in Europe were connected to each other because of their similar way of life and inter-marriages.\nAristocrats owned large estates in the country side and town houses.\nFrench was a common language spoken by the aristocracy for diplomacy and high society.\nA majority of the European population was made up of peasants.\nIn the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, new social groups came into existence. They were:\nWorking class\nMiddle class\nThe middle class was characterised by its free-thinking liberal mindset.\nThe middle class wanted the end of autocratic rule and form a people\u2019s government.\nThe word liberalism traces its roots from the Latin word \u2018liber,\u2019 meaning freedom. The concept of liberalism was born in the middle class.\nThe middle class believed in the need for freedom and equality of all individuals before law.\nAlthough liberalism popularised the idea of a people\u2019s government, the right to vote or suffrage was not extended to all citizens.\nIn France, women were given the status of a minor and subjugated to the authority of men.\nThroughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, women and non-propertied men organised protests and movements demanding equal rights.\nLiberalism implied freedom of markets, and unrestricted movement of goods and capital.\nThe Napoleonic Code, though revolutionary for its time, was not able to address the growing needs of the industrialists.\nIn 1834, a customs union or \u2018Zollverein` was formed at the initiative of Prussia and joined by most of the German states.\nThis union eliminated tariff barriers and reduced the number of currencies from over 30 to 2.\nA railway network was also formed which enhanced mobility and communication.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd\n\nLearnNext is an interactive, computer-based self-learning solution which helps students retain concepts better and perfect them with exhaustive practice and tests.

Their rivalry caused many wars and culminated in the First World War.\nLater, in the nineteenth century, the countries colonised by the European powers began to overthrow their imperial domination.\nMany countries struggled for the formation of nation states and each country was inspired by a sense of collective national unity.\nEvery country developed its own specific nationalism; there was one thing in common - the idea of organising societies as nation states.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd\n\nLearnNext is an interactive, computer-based self-learning solution which helps students retain concepts better and perfect them with exhaustive practice and tests.

It was also known as the liberty cap. French people wore these caps a few days before the storming of the Bastille.\nDuring revolutions, artists represented nation as a person in order to put life into abstract concepts like a nation.\nThe way of expressing an abstract idea like freedom or liberty through a symbol that may be person or thing is known as allegory. An allegory has a literal and a symbolic meaning.\nIn the 19th century, French artists used the female allegory, Marianne, to represent France.\nMarianne symbolises reason, liberty and the ideals of the republic\nShe wore a red cap and a knotted ribbon or cockade, and carried the French tricolour.\nStatues of Marianne were erected in public squares to familiarize people with Marianne as the national symbol of unity.\nImages of Marianne were used on coins and stamps.\nIn Germany, the allegory for nation was again a female figure called Germania.\nShe wears a crown of oak leaves, a symbol of heroism in Germany.\nGermania wears a breastplate with an eagle, which is a symbol of German strength.\nThe black, red and gold tricolour in Germania\u2019s hand is the flag of the liberal nationalists of 1848.\nThe sword in Germania\u2019s hand is a symbol of her readiness to fight.\nA flag is the symbol of unity and encourages people to be united.\nThe personification of a nation infused feelings of patriotism and nationalism in people.\n\nTo watch the complete lesson, register to get 5-day full access for free\nvisit - http://bit.ly/2KbImVd\n\nLearnNext is an interactive, computer-based self-learning solution which helps students retain concepts better and perfect them with exhaustive practice and tests.

The later women suffrages movements made people aware of the rights of women to vote and own property.\nFamilies became smaller and people had more time for leisure. \nRich people visited pleasure gardens equipped with sports facilities, entertainment and refreshments. \nThe State sponsored libraries, art galleries and museums, for the working classes, to educate, to entertain and to instil a sense of pride in people.\nCinema became the new form of mass entertainment.\nGroups of people could be drawn into political causes.
