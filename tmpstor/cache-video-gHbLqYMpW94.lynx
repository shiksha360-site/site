About TicTacLearn - 
We firmly believe that education is the greatest equalizer of all! But unfortunately, we live in a world where access to quality learning resources is limited and comes with an associated price-tag, effectively perpetuating inequity in the society.

We have set out to change that.
At TICTACLEARN we believe that digital content has the power to reshape the learning spaces in the country and we want to take it one step closer to every learner, educator and parent. With that in mind we have created one of the largest open-source repositories of high-quality, curriculum aligned digital learning resources (~12,000 videos, aligned item bank, etc.) available for everyone, free of cost! Furthermore, we know that educational resources are most effective when in the learners native language, and hence we aim to make our videos available in all major Indian languages.
