In this module, you will learn about biogeochemical cycles â€“ the water cycle and the nitrogen cycle.
What is the biogeochemical cycle?
The cycling of chemicals between the biological and the geological world is called biogeochemical cycle.
The biotic and abiotic components of the biosphere constantly interact through these cycles.
These interactions enable the transfer of nutrients between living organisms and nonliving environment.
What are the four most important biogeochemical cycles?
The four most important biogeochemical cycles are water cycle, nitrogen cycle, carbon cycle, and oxygen cycle.
