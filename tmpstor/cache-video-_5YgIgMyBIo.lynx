The multiplication of matrices is not similar to their addition or subtraction. 
In the addition and subtraction operations over matrices, we perform the operations element by element. 
In multiplication, however, we multiply the elements in a row of the first matrix by the elements in a column of the second matrix.
Letâ€™s see the procedure.  
We have two matrices X and Y. 
Let the resulting matrix of the multiplication of these matrices be Z. 
We will first multiply the elements in the first row of X to the corresponding elements in the first column of Y.
We will write the sum of the products of the elements as shown. 
Then we multiply the elements in the first row X to the elements in the second column of Y. 
We will write the sum of the products of the elements as shown.
In a similar manner, we multiply the elements in the other rows and columns. 
Finally, we get the matrix as shown. 
Letâ€™s see an example with the matrices shown. 
First, we will take the first row of A and the first column of B, and multiply the elements one by one, as shown. 
Similarly, we multiply all the rows of A with all the columns of B.
