In this module, you will learn about the gait of animals.

The body movements are possible in humans because of several bones and joints. Let us see how the movement takes place in some of the smaller animals.
 
How does an earthworm move?

Earthwormâ€™s body secretes a slimy substance that helps it to move. The tiny stiff hair-like projections, called bristles, under their body help them to grab the soil. 
They first stretch out and then contract the muscles to move. 
They draw out the front part of their body, keeping the back fixed to the ground. And, then they release the back portion keeping the front part fixed. Hence, they cover only a small distance with every move.
They can move with ease on a hard and slippery surface.
.The intestine throws away undigested matter as small pellets into the soil. This improves the quality of the soil for plants.
