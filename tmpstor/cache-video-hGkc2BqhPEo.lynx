In this module, you will learn about the separation of substances under dry conditions.
Handpicking is the basic method for separation of substances.
It involves simply picking out substances by hand and separating them from others.
The substances being separated may be impurities that have to be thrown away.
Or it may be that both the substances being separated are useful â€“ such as if you separate green grapes from black ones from a mixture of the two.
There are other alternative methods to separate substances such as threshing.
This is done after harvesting of crops.
Once wheat is harvested, the stalks are dried.
Then, each grain of wheat is separated from the stalks to which it is attached so that it can be ground into flour.
This method of separating grains from stalks is called threshing.
It is basically the beating of these dry stalks to shake off the dried grains.
It can be done by hand, by cattle, or by using machines.
Traditionally, threshing was done by hand, but cattle help to do this job quickly.
Nowadays, threshing machines are also used to separate large quantities of grain at a time.
One of these machines is a combine harvester.
