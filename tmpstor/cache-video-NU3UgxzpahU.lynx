In this module you will learn about different types of lenses and the characteristics of images formed by convex lenses
Have you ever seen through a peephole?
Images seen through a peephole are different from those seen through a normal glass.
Do you know what kind of lens is that?
Itâ€™s a concave lens.
This lens in our peephole makes objects appear smaller!
Have you ever seen a person repairing a watch?  How does he manage to locate and fix such tiny parts? 
See the eyepiece? It has a lens that magnifies the images of the parts of a watch.
Take a look at this magnifying glass.

The watch repairer uses a convex lens. This lens makes objects placed close to it appear larger, when seen through it.
