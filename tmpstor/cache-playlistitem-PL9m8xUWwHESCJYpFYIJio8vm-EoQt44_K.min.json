However, a more meaningful comparison between the quantities can be made by using division, i.e. by verifying how many times one quantity is into the other quantity.  This method is known as comparison by ratio.

The tiny stiff hair-like projections, called bristles, under their body help them to grab the soil. \nThey first stretch out and then contract the muscles to move. \nThey draw out the front part of their body, keeping the back fixed to the ground.
